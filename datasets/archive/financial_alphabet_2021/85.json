"During the first quarter of 2021, we continued to benefit from elevated consumer activity online and broad-based increases in advertiser spending. We remain focused on innovating and investing in the services we offer to consumers and businesses to support our long-term growth. For example, we continue to invest in our technical infrastructure and data centers. Additionally, certain expenses continued to be lower due to the ongoing pandemic, such as advertising and promotional, and travel and entertainment. These factors, combined with the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the first quarter of 2020, positively affected year-on-year growth trends in our financial results. Further, year-on-year trends benefited from a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment beginning in the first quarter of 2021; we expect the effect of this change in estimate to decline through the remainder of the year (for further details see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, be unpredictable and affect our business and financial results. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and historical trends in our financial results may differ materially."
