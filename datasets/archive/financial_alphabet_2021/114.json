"R&D expenses increased $665 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses of $861 million, largely resulting from a 10% increase in headcount. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of $161\u00a0million including the effect of our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment."
