"Paid clicks increased from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily driven by interrelated factors, including an increase in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; continued growth in advertiser activity; improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery; and the adverse effect of COVID-19 on the prior period. Growth was also driven by an increase in clicks relating to ads on Google Play. The increase in cost-per click was primarily driven by the adverse effect of COVID-19 on the prior period as well as the effect of a combination of factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies."
