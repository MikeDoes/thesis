"In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4\u00a0billion ($2.7\u00a0billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3\u00a0billion ($5.1\u00a0billion as of June 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5\u00a0billion ($1.7\u00a0billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines."
