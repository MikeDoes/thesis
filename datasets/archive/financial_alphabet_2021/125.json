"Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in the provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in pre-tax earnings, including in countries that have higher statutory rates, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax deduction benefit and stock-based compensation related tax benefit.
