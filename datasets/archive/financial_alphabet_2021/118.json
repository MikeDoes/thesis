"General and administrative expenses decreased $107 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $493 million decline in allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, as the prior year period reflected a higher allowance related to the economic impact of COVID-19. The decrease was partially offset by $236\u00a0million in charges relating to certain legal matters."
