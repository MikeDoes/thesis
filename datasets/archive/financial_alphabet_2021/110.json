"The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube as well as data center and other operations costs. The increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment beginning in the first quarter of 2021."
