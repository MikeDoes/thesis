"As a result of COVID-19, our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended March\u00a031, 2021. While we continue to evolve our work model in response to the uneven effects of the ongoing pandemic around the world, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be effective. We have continued to re-evaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely."
