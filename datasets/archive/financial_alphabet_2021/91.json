"Google Search & other revenues increased $7,377 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The overall growth was primarily driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, growth in advertiser spending, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. The adverse effect of COVID-19 on prior period revenues also contributed to the year-over-year increase."
