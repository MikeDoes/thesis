"Revenues and certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering, and hardware costs and other operating expenses, are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount."
