"Sales and marketing expenses increased $16 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses of $368 million, largely resulting from an 8% increase in headcount. This increase was largely offset by decreases in advertising and promotional as well as travel and entertainment expenses totaling $268 million, primarily as a result of COVID-19."
