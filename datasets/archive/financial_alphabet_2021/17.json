"In January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December\u00a031, 2020, and those acquired during the quarter ended March\u00a031, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $835\u00a0million and an increase in net income of $650\u00a0million, or $0.97 per basic and $0.95 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2021."
