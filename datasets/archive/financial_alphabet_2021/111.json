"The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 22.1% to 21.7% from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to a combination of factors none of which were individually significant. The TAC rate on Google properties revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network  properties revenues were both substantially consistent from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021."
