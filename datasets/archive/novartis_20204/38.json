"At a recent Congress in San Antonio, we were very proud to share that Kisqali\u00ae demonstrated the longest median overall survival among all Phase III trials in advanced breast cancer, reaching nearly 5 years of survival in premenopausal patients. And additionally, we presented the pooled data from MONALEESA studies that confirmed efficacy across luminal and estrogen therapy-resistant HER2-enriched patient subtypes. And these data confirm that Kisqali\u00ae's ability to selectively inhibit CDK4 may store endocrine sensitivity in these very aggressive tumors. On the development side, the NATALEE adjuvant study in intermediate- and high-risk populations is enrolling incredibly well, and we are on track for final readout in 2022. So overall, we are very pleased with the performance of Kisqali\u00ae and remain very confident in this brand."
