"Now for 2021, the half year effect, we have a little under 2% on the top line what we expect. So again, it depends very much on how quarter 2/quarter 3 go. We have several scenarios which we try to put here on the guidance. Never easy. But I think we have to be a bit careful around when our patient visits and initiations back to pre-COVID normal, which we do expect as of the summer as of Q3."
