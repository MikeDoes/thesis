"On Slide 36, I would like to explain the dynamics that we expect to see in quarter 1, given that we had quite a significant COVID impact last year quarter 1, which of course would impact the growth rate. So as you recall, there was a significant forward purchasing in quarter 1 of last year and worth approximately 3 points of growth that largely reversed in quarter 2 with no overall impact on the full year 2020. So as a result, in quarter 1 2021, we anticipate sales to decline low to mid-single digits year-on-year. The quarter 1 underlying performance, excluding the stocking effect, is expected to be broadly in line with prior year due to the continued COVID-19 impact on health care systems and patient visits."
