"A. Thank you very much, Graham. So very exact numbers are hard to grab, right, on what is purely COVID? But as we compare to our forecast and of course the analytics around it, which we're doing constantly, I would say, starting with the impact we experienced in 2020, between 2 and 3 percent points of sales growth, we would attribute as a negative. On the bottom line, given the cost discipline as well as some of the natural underspend, as you have seen, we have made up more than that. And it could even increase our core operating income guidance."
