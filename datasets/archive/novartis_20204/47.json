"So turning to Slide 31. We compare our actual results here with our 2020 latest guidance. And as you know, we've revised our core operating income guidance upward in October. And I'm pleased to say that we met both core operating income and the sales guidance. On sales, given the resurgence of COVID-19 in quarter 4, we ended at the low end of the 3% to 4% range, as we mentioned during the quarter 3 investor call."
