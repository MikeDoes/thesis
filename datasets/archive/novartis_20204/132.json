"A. Yes. So on \u2013 thanks, Simon. On Zolgensma\u00ae, outside of the US, of course, we have access in Germany through the Standard Access path there. We have reimbursement in Japan. And we're working very \u2013 and we have a limited reimbursement program right now in a few other European countries, particularly Italy \u2013 notably Italy. What we hope to be able to accomplish in the first half of this year is to establish reimbursement pathways in the UK, Italy, Spain, Canada and a number of other markets. We'll see \u2013 those discussions, as I mentioned, have been a little delayed due to the pandemic, but we're hopeful we can accelerate them."
