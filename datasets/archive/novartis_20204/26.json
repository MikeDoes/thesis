"So going on to Slide 16. Good morning, good afternoon. I'm pleased to update you on the 2020 performance for Pharma. We grew 5% year-over-year in a challenging environment. And our growth drivers, Cosentyx\u00ae and Entresto\u00ae, showed continued momentum and now account for USD 6.5 billion in revenues. But the story that stands out here is the shift that you see in our portfolio. The contribution from growth drivers and launches went from 33% to 43%, and that demonstrates our replacement power in light of several patent expiries expected. We're delivering strong operational performance in the in-market growth drivers. We also made progress in the next wave of potential launches, providing the basis for growth in 2021 and beyond."
