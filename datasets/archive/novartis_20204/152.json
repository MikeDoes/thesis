"A. Yes. Thanks, Peter. On iscalimab, this is our anti-CD40, as you know. We had intentions of moving forward, and we still have intentions of moving forward, with 2 or 3 indications: Renal transplant, liver transplant as well as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s. We took an aggressive clinical strategy, given that there's really been no improvement or change of standard of care for renal transplant in 35 years other than calcineurin inhibitors."
