"Then when you look at some of the proof points. As we've set out on this journey, we believe we're making good progress. Always more to do, always things to learn, but we're making good progress. We're 100% focused now as a medicines company. We have a leading pipeline across 10 therapeutic areas, 4 advanced therapy platforms, unique in that having only 8% of our sales in 1 product and over 15 blockbusters. We've achieved USD 2 billion in cost savings over the last 3 years. A leading data science platform that's enabling us to weather this pandemic and, I believe, sets us up for the medium and long term. Consistently improving ESG scores, now with sector-leading performance in 4 key indices. And from a culture standpoint, record-high engagement scores across multiple different measures."
