"Q. A quick one for Richard on Sandoz. Could you please share with us, how do you see the dynamic of the non-biosimilar business? Because we see understand how \u2013 what is driving this business. But for the rest of the portfolio, it's a bit more difficult to understand. Could you maybe elaborate on this, on the midterm dynamic of the non-biosimilar business?"
