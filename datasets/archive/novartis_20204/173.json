"Q. So really just wanted to get an update on iscalimab in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease. I think previously, you had stated that you were planning for either an interim towards the end of this year or perhaps even a final look at those data. So just wanted to get an update on iscalimab in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease. And maybe if you could just give us a little color on the ability to recruit patients or continue recruiting patients into that study. If recruitment is completed, then obviously, that question is irrelevant."
