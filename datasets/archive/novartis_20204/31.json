"We think that B-cell therapies have the potential to account to up to 40% of market share in MS. And we're positioning Kesimpta\u00ae as a first-choice DMT as we relentlessly track for the highest customer satisfaction. We have the foundational elements in place. We're focusing on breadth. And with our free drug program, once we're out of this pandemic and we can pull our full promotional power behind Kesimpta\u00ae, we will really see the potential of this product."
