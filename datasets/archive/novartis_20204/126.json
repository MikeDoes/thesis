"A. So when we go back to what I said before, it really depends on the addressable pool of patients. We're very encouraged by the conversations that we've heard coming out of the AdComm, and now we're in discussions with FDA around the exact wording of the label. And it will depend on the patient pool. As I said before, this is a significant population, but it's also an underdiagnosed population, so we'll have to take things as it comes. It's very encouraging, as we have seen from the PARAGON data, that there are groups of patients that do benefit. And there's a general consensus with physicians that this is not an exact science. So having an ejection fraction below normal and looking at precise rates is not something that is an exact science, so we're working to make sure that we can bring this product to the largest population possible and where it makes sense."
