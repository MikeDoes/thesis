"What I can say in the meantime is that the team is doing an incredible job with the launch. We've seen access, and we beat our own internal benchmarks on access. We're seeing naive patients at 17%. We have leading share of attention. We've made sure that we focus on making fast initiations and making it easy. So we're in good shape. We're building the foundation. We have a good free goods program. And we're hoping to accelerate the sales in the second half of the year."
