"A. Yes. On iscalimab, thanks for the question, Seamus. As Vas disclosed earlier, we're really not disclosing the interims moving forward. So as we're moving forward, the recruitment has been a little bit slower than we anticipated. We're not fully recruited in the Phase IIb for iscalimab yet. So the recruitment continues, and those time lines really will depend on when we finish recruitment. So we'll provide further updates in terms of the exact timing of completion of that trial."
