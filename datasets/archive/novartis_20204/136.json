"And I have to say you were asking if there is impact from COVID, and yes, there is because some treatments are delayed. But on the other side, I think within the market, Kymriah\u00ae has performed exceptionally well. We have gained market share. And I think this is probably driven by the strong data that we, also in real-word evidence, could demonstrate that efficacy and also safety is even better than in the JULIET trial. So I think very, very strong. And I think very safe product that would not require ICU space. And I think this led probably to the decision by many centers to go for Kymriah\u00ae."
