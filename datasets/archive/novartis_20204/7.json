"Now turning to this year's performance \u2013 sorry, the 2020 performance and Q4 performance. On Slide 7, you can see a breakdown of some of the key drivers. As you saw in our release, net sales for the full year were up 3% and core operating income up 13%. Our overall performance in Q4 as well as the full year were driven by our key growth drivers, Entresto\u00ae and Cosentyx\u00ae, continuing to demonstrate double-digit growth, a broad range of oncology medicines also demonstrating double-digit growth. And taken together, we now have over half of our sales coming from our key growth drivers and launches in Innovative Medicines, positioning us well for the future and positioning us well to overcome the patent expiries we have in this period and continue to drive growth through 2025 and beyond."
