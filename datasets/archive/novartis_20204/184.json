"In terms of small molecules, the softness we saw was primarily in anti-infectives in Europe as well as the legacy, the oral solids business we brought back from Aurobindo. What we're hopeful now is that hopefully we see demand start to pick up again over the course of this year, but much more important is revitalizing our pipeline and revitalizing our first-to-file engine in the US and being at market formation in Europe. We think the combination of those two pillars, the biosimilars pipeline and the first-to-file pipeline, should get us to that mid-single-digit growth rate over time."
