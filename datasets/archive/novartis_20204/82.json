"Q. Two questions, please. One, Vas, at the CMD in late November, you expressed confidence in consensus. And I think a lot of investors took that to mean each year rather than just 2025. Now the '21 guide seems to be somewhat below consensus. So you obviously had good visibility on the challenges of COVID in late November. So can you just tell people if there is anything that's fundamentally changed since late November? Or really, it's just the pattern of growth out to 2025 that potentially was misinterpreted."
