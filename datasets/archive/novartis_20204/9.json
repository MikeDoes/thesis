"As you saw in Q4, we had sales of USD 254 million, which were lower than Q3. This was driven primarily by COVID-19-related impact, delaying new starts as hospitals faced disruption and we saw physicians delaying starts or switches to the product, as well as delays in reimbursement decisions in some of the European and emerging markets we're currently working with. We expect this impact to continue through the first half of 2021, where we would expect sales in that Q3/Q4 range before an acceleration in the second half of the year."
