"Now kind of 2 questions for me, broad picture, please. First, kind of your slide on the BeiGene collaboration suggests that you are open to a broader strategic collaboration with BeiGene. Maybe I'm overinterpreting that sentence, but would love to hear kind of what you are envisaging there. Is this kind of a corporate collaboration? Is it a collaboration from an oncology perspective? Is this for Novartis to sell stuff into China? Why have them for you to import innovation? Just anything you can add to that would be great."
