"And then secondly, a question on CANOPY-1. There's been quite a lot of investor discussion around timing of interims. I think some investors interpreted management comments made recently that there's definitely no interims in first half of '21. So can you clarify if that's correct? Or if you're just saying you're just not disclosing timing? And just leave us guessing if it could happen at any point between now and the final analysis in Q4?"
