"We are also committed to deliver on our launches. We will further expand Piqray\u00ae in the US and gain momentum in Europe. And we hope to continue strong on Adakveo\u00ae, expanding to larger accounts in the US and continued global rollout. We will further maximize the first-mover advantage with Tabrecta\u00ae in the US and we'll continue driving awareness of CML and the unmet need and the importance of STAMP inhibitors."
