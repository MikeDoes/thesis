"Q. Just one on M&A, please. You've had a couple of large deals which have resulted in some issues where we argue that, if those assets were developed internally, the likelihood of those problems arising would have been probably much less likely to have occurred. I'm thinking the AveXis data integrity issues, the Leqvio\u00ae CDMO issues. And given that even the most diligent of acquirers would have been probably unlucky to have found those issues, does it dim your enthusiasm for future deals of this size given the risks involved?"
