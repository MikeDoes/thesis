"Now moving to Slide 13, other innovation milestones that we expect for 2021. Multiple major approvals, Kesimpta\u00ae in the EU, Entresto\u00ae HFpEF for an expanded indication for Entresto\u00ae. A number of major submissions, you can see is listed here, including asciminib in CML. We have also a range of major readouts which would enable submissions in 2021, notably canakinumab, sabatolimab, MBG453, and Lu-PSMA, amongst others. We also will hope to see the readouts of ligelizumab and Cosentyx\u00ae, which would enable submissions in 2022."
