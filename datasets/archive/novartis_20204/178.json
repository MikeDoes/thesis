"A. Yes. Thanks, Richard. So we're in discussions now with FDA on finalizing that clinical trial design. I think the discussions are very positive both on dose and duration, but we haven't finalized the design. Hopefully, by Q1, we'll be able to give you at least a perspective on what the agreed design of the study is, assuming we get off clinical hold later on in the year. So still more to come, and we'll keep you posted."
