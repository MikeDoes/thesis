"We'd like to share with you the exciting data we have recently presented at ASH on asciminib, our first-in-class STAMP inhibitor that has the potential to transform CML treatment standards. In the Phase III ASCEMBL trial, asciminib nearly doubled the major molecular response rate at 24 weeks compared to bosutinib in patients resistant to or intolerant of at least 2 prior TKIs. Asciminib also demonstrated favorable safety profile, underscoring that STAMP inhibition reduces the off-target adverse events typical for TKIs. The US FDA has granted fast track designation earlier in December, and we are on track with the US and EU submissions in the first half of '21. We also continue evaluating multiple development options for asciminib in early treatment lines in CML, and looking forward to update you in the future."
