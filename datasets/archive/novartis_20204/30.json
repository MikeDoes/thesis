"If we move to Slide 20 and on to Kesimpta\u00ae. We've said we have high expectations for this product. Our team is executing very effectively on the launch. In fact, we have beat all of our plans on gaining access. We're seeing broad adoption. We have leading share of attention. Onboarding is fast and initiation is simple. But we do feel that it is more challenging to launch during a pandemic. We cannot move as fast as we would like due to the limited face-to-face access to physicians. And what we're also seeing is a hesitancy to switch as physicians and patients prefer to wait. But this does not change our ambition for this product."
