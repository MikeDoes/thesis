"A. Yes, I'm very happy to get at least one question on Cosentyx\u00ae. So the first thing I'd say is I think we need to put this in perspective because our overall access position in the US remains incredibly strong. In fact, you heard me say that before, early line access is a key pillar to our strategy. However, we're always going to balance access with long-term sustainability for Cosentyx\u00ae, and you can expect us to continue to do that."
