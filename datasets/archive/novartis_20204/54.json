"Turning to Slide 37. In 2021, we do expect further margin expansion, as mentioned earlier, with core operating income growth. And the magnitude, however, will be lower compared to 2020 where we increased core margins by 280 basis points. Expected positive drivers of future core operating income growth include the continued performance of our growth drivers, the launch uptake of Kesimpta\u00ae and other launches, as well as productivity programs and continuing adoption of our new ways of working. Growth will be partly offset by increased launch and prelaunch investments, mainly Kesimpta\u00ae and Leqvio\u00ae, as well as development costs for tislelizumab, which we recently in-licensed from BeiGene, of course only after the completion of the transaction. We will also likely see further investments into growth drivers as we expect physician access to normalize from the middle of the year."
