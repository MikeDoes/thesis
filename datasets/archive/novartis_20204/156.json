"A. Yes, Peter. I mean, as you know, there is one generic company that has achieved marketing authorization in Europe and is doing a very targeted commercialization, currently being really commercialized only in 8 markets, including Germany, France and UK. Our guidance for the US is based on the fact that this same company has application running in the US since a while. We have no update at this point. But given also the situation with COVID, we expect that this process could take longer. But there is no concrete update and there is no new information."
