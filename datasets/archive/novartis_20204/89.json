"Q. The inclisiran situation in the US is perplexing. 2 months ago, Novartis had been anticipating a year-end 2020 approval, then said the facility review only related to paperwork and might not be needed. And now the product appears delayed a year in the US. So something seems not right, and I'm wondering what perspective you can add."
