"A. Yes. Thanks, Steve. On the inclisiran topic, it's been certainly an interesting journey for us as well. I mean, this is a situation where we had a facility. Routine inspection would have happened in May. Due to the pandemic, the FDA converted this to a paper-based inspection. The third party provided the documentation, and the entire interaction has been purely based in writing. There have been no verbal conversations. And these, of course, have happened in writing with the third-party facility."
