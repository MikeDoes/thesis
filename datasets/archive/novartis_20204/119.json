"Q. Two questions. Firstly, on Kesimpta\u00ae. I just wondered to what degree the launch and the class overall is being impacted by patients delaying treatment initiation due to either worries over immunosuppression or potential lack of response to COVID vaccination. I've noticed a couple of recent publications underlying a 2x increased risk of severe COVID with B-cell depleted. So just wondered if you could comment on that and what degree that impact on the class might linger longer term as we come out of the pandemic."
