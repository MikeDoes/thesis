"I think what's important is what Marie-France and the team mentioned, what she mentioned. If anything, this is an opportunity for us to prepare even better for the launch. We don't have to launch this medicine in the midst of a pandemic. We have the opportunity now to build an even stronger launch-preparedness effort and then hopefully get off to a strong start as soon as the product is approved."
