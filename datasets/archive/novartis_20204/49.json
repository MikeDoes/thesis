"Next, let's focus on the core margins on Slide 33, again showing on the right-hand, full year; and left-hand, quarter 4. For the full year, continuing operations core margin was 31.7%, growing 280 basis points in constant currencies, with strong improvements in both divisions. Innovative Medicines margin reached 35%, as outlooked, up 220 basis points, allowing us to achieve our previously announced mid-30s core margin target a couple of years earlier than planned. And Sandoz margin grew by 330 basis points to 24.2%. Clearly, our full year margins show we are well on track to deliver on our Innovative Medicines margin targets of the high 30s in the midterm as well as our Sandoz margin target of mid- to high 20s in the midterm. Let's go to the next slide."
