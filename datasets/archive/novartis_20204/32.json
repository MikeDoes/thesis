"If we move on to Slide 21. We're also enthusiastically preparing for the launch of Leqvio\u00ae. Leqvio\u00ae received EU approval in December, and we expect a slow and steady start. We also plan to roll out our first population health agreement with the UK NHS in quarter 3. In the US, as you've heard, we have a manufacturing-related delay which we're working to resolve, but what is important to remember is that we're thinking about this launch very differently. Our aim is to partner with health care systems on ASCVD management to overcome the nonclinical barriers to tackling this disease at scale. We're now using this time to advance our engagement with health care systems and to set up the needed infrastructure so that we can be stronger out of the gate once we get the green light from FDA."
