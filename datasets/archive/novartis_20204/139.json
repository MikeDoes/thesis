"Q. A couple of questions left for me, please. Firstly, on the BeiGene PD-1. I wonder if you can just talk through why you took the decision to bring that on board, given you have spartalizumab. And what did that asset really offer that yours did not? Was it just timing? Or is there something else here we have to be aware of? Should we assume spartalizumab is now \u2013 will you continue those ongoing combinations studies to that asset as well?"
