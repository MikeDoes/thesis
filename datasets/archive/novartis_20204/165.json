"In terms of the mid- to long-term ambitions, I think nothing more to add. Of course, as a CEO who wants our company to lead and be the leading medicines company in the industry, have very high ambitions. But I think more appropriate for me to keep those ambitions to myself and continue to simply say we're comfortable, as we've said, stated with our sales and margin outlook from the consensus out to 2025. And we'll do our best to deliver a world-class pipeline portfolio and execution across all 5 of our strategic priorities to get that. And then most important, in my mind, is to continue a strong growth trajectory beyond 2025 as well because we of course play this for the very long game."
