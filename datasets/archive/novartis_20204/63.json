"Q. It's Mark Purcell from Morgan Stanley. So just to \u2013 firstly, for Harry. Harry, could you just help us further with the sort of phasing of growth through the course of the year? So as you said, for Q1, underlying growth roughly flat. Should we assume a similar thing for Q2, which sort of sets you up for 8% to 9% sales growth in the second half of the year to reach the guidance? And is there anything you see in terms of the phasing of Sandoz, which we may not have as much visibility on, which is different to that pattern?"
