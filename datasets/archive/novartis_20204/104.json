"A. Thanks, Harry. And then on the interim guidance, maybe rather than getting specific on CANOPY-1, in general, we have interim data readouts across our programs and we're no longer disclosing the timing of those interim readouts. We'd rather have investors focus on the full data readout \u2013 full timing of data readouts based on the powering of these studies. They're powered, of course, to read out at the close of the study. And so we continue to guide to CANOPY-2 in the first half, CANOPY-1 in the second half, CANOPY-Adjuvant in '22."
