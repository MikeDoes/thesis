"Now moving to Slide 10. With respect to Sandoz, you saw in the full year, Sandoz met the sales guidance, largely in line for the full year and the quarter. Importantly, Sandoz was able to drive 15% core operating income growth, moving its core margin up to 24.2%. Some of the pushes and pulls for Sandoz are: Continued strong Biopharmaceuticals performance with 19% growth, primarily in the European market; but also held back a bit by our retail declines we saw driven by COVID-19 and the US oral solids business that we now retain. I think, taking a longer-term view on Sandoz, we remain determined to build a business that can grow mid-single-digit with margins in the mid- to high 20s, really competitive with the top end of the peer set. And we expect to be able to do that through a robust biosimilars pipeline as well as high LOE coverage amongst small molecules through the 2024 period."
