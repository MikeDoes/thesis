"The AdComm discussion for pEF reinforced the unmet need as well as Entresto\u00ae's value in the treatment of preserved ejection fraction, and specifically in patients with ejection fraction below normal. Ultimately, the addressable patient pool will depend on the label. What I can tell you is that the total pEF population is about 3 million in the US and about 2 million of them have an ejection fraction below normal. We know from our deep experience in rEFs that guidelines matter in this market, so our update will be gradual as the guidelines evolve. Overall, we're very comfortable with Entresto\u00ae's peak consensus, and we're confident that Entresto\u00ae is going to continue on its impressive growth trajectory."
