"2020 was definitely a year like no other. But the external environment did not stop us from doing what we're passionate about, and that is bringing medicines to patients. Our teams have worked hard and demonstrated great agility and resilience, and I am very proud of this team. Our 2021 strategy builds on the good work done. Number one, we want to maintain the momentum on Cosentyx\u00ae and Entresto\u00ae, penetrating markets further and delivering on our life cycle management programs; two, executing our launches, ramping up Kesimpta\u00ae, bringing Leqvio\u00ae to market and restoring confidence in Beovu\u00ae; and three, getting ready for the next wave of launches. Geographically, we have a clear focus on the US and China, and we're putting our customers at the core of our strategy. You will see us working in a much more personalized fashion with physicians, leveraging the investments that we've made in data and digital, and with health care systems to deliver access to more patients faster.
