"Now moving to Slide 12. Turning to our innovation performance and innovation milestones in Q4, we saw the approval of Leqvio\u00ae in the EU 6 months ahead of schedule. We saw the positive FDA AdComm for Entresto\u00ae in preserved ejection fraction heart failure, as well as a number of other notable achievements, a number of designations achieved for iptacopan and ligelizumab, I think, demonstrating the potential of these medicines as they continue to progress in late-stage development. We also signed an important in-licensing deal on tislelizumab with BeiGene for anti-PD-1, which we hope we'll be able to file later this year in the US and other markets."
