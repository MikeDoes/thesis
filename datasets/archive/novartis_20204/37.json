"Moving to Slide 25 and Kisqali\u00ae. Kisqali\u00ae delivered a very strong performance in 2020 with full year sales up 45%, reaching USD 870 million. And this is driven by the unprecedented overall survival benefit from 2 pivotal Phase III clinical trials. We are also very pleased to see Kisqali\u00ae continue growing and gaining market share despite the overall slowdown of the CDK4/6 market, driven by suppressed patient screening and overall decrease in new patient starts."
