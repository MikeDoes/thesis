"A. Yes. Thank you, Simon. So we were really pleased with the performance of Kymriah\u00ae also in Q4. Very strong growth. And this was really driven by double-digit growth across the geographies, in the US, in Europe and Japan, and this despite COVID. I would say that the growth is partially driven by the expanding in new markets. As I said, there is now 27 markets that have reimbursement for at least one of the Kymriah\u00ae indications. The increased manufacturing capacity, which means that we could serve all the demand."
