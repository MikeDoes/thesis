"I would still say, in general, I mean, the biggest constraint right now on Zolgensma\u00ae growth is more the pandemic than the underlying demand. We see very good dynamics, very solid AAV testing rates around the world. We see a strong interest for governments to put in place reimbursement programs, but it does take more time in the pandemic. We do see physicians delaying starts with Zolgensma\u00ae simply because of the initiation procedures involved with such a therapy. So we're hopeful that as the pandemic recedes or health care systems stabilize, we'll see an acceleration over the course of the year."
