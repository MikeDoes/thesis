"Another effect we had in quarter 2 is that Lucentis\u00ae, basically, many patients skipped or doctors skipped one injection. That's now fully back. So quarter 2, we should see some good growth. And so the first half, I would say, we do expect to be broadly in line with prior year, maybe low single-digit growth as totality, right? First, decline in quarter 1 and then some good growth in quarter 2 is the expectation."
