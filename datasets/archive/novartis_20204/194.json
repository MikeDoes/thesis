"A. Yes, thank you. So it's a bit complicated. But first of all, we do account for the appropriate, if you will, share of development costs of the current registration trials in our core P&L. It's about 1 point of core operating income growth, if you will, from a dilution standpoint. But it will not be a cash expense because the current portfolio is being executed by BeiGene and is part of our upfront payment. So it's not a cash expense, but an expense. Given the structure of the deal, we always want to ensure that our core results and the core accounting is of the highest quality as well."
