"On the development side, we were pleased to share the new data from the ELARA trial, showing that Kymriah\u00ae is effective in pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. Submission for this important indication is expected later this year. And we have also presented the JULIET updated efficacy results, which showed continued durable responses for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. We also continue to invest in our CAR-T therapies with already 2 new CAR-T assets in Phase I trials being manufactured on a completely novel CAR-T platform. With this technology, we expect to increase manufacturing reliability, shorten the turnaround times and the preservation of certain T cell subpopulations. Moving to the next slide."
