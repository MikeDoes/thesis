"And then secondly, on Entresto\u00ae, just a clarification. Based on the patient populations that you're pointing to for the preserved ejection fraction indication, it sounds like you think the labeling discussions will be around kind of ejection fraction cutoffs rather than necessarily restricting by sex. So I just wondered if you could confirm that. And if you are able to quantify what you think the opportunity for Entresto\u00ae is in the PARADISE-MI setting, that would be really helpful."
