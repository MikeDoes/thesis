"A. So thank you, Laura. Our bridging program is available for commercial patients for up to 12 months. So we've had a generous program, and I can tell you that the majority of Kesimpta\u00ae patients are currently on this bridging program. We expect the conversion to paid products with share of free goods to decline from 70% to 30% over the course of the year, and that will obviously drive up the sales ramp-up. What's important here is that we expect three quarters of the '21 sales to be realized in the second half of the year. And this, of course, assumes the pandemic recovery in line with our group guidance."
