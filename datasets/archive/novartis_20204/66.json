"A. Yes. Thank you, Mark. Yes, the last year was quite interesting with the forward buy, if you will, as health care systems try to get some inventory and also at the patient level, longer scripts have been given. So we have this USD 400 million roughly effect of forward buy or stocking in quarter 1 and then they destocked in quarter 2. That's roughly 3 points on our quarter. So of course, then quarter 2 would have the reversed positive effect."
