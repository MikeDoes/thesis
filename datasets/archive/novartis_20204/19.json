"We expect, based on the third party's readiness to complete the request made by FDA, to be able to submit the documentation and other requests of FDA in the Q2/Q3 time period. We still do not know if the FDA will ultimately want to inspect this facility. As noted previously, the FDA had originally planned to inspect this facility in May of 2020. They are currently not conducting overseas inspections in situations like this. So we'll continue to have to work with the FDA to try to expedite that inspection. And we're concurrently working on a tech transfer to add our own Novartis facility in Schaftenau for the production supply chain of Leqvio\u00ae."
