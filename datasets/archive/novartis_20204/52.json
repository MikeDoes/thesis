"The Sandoz guidance is due to the impact of COVID on our retail business and expected decline of US oral solids business. The key assumption for this guidance, importantly, is that we see a return to normal global health care systems and prescribing dynamics by the middle of 2021. And in addition, we assume that no Gilenya\u00ae and no Sandostatin\u00ae LAR generics enter in 2021 in the US. Please also note that the overall generic impact is expected to be in the range of the negative minus 3% on sales, similar to what we saw in 2020. We expect there to be continued generic erosion on brands, including Afinitor\u00ae, Exjade\u00ae, Gleevec\u00ae, also with some mature ophtha brands and Diovan\u00ae."
