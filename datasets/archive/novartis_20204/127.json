"And on AMI, so we'll obviously have to wait for the results of the trials. But our data tells us there are about 7 million AMI events every year across the globe, and 1 in 4 will develop heart failure. So in the US alone, we're talking about 800,000 patients suffering from AMI every year, and these might benefit from Entresto\u00ae. So we've got strong access for this product that we've built over the years. We've got a great team. And we hope to bring Entresto\u00ae to a large incremental population if the results of the trial are positive."
