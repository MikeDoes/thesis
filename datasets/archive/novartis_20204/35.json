"The Oncology business had solid performance despite significant generic erosion and COVID impact, delivering 3% growth and reaching USD 14.7 billion. In Q4, we have seen very good momentum across our portfolio, mainly driven by the strong uptake of our recent launches and continued strong performance of our growth drivers. And these brands could also more than compensate for the continued generic erosion of Afinitor\u00ae and Exjade\u00ae/Jadenu\u00ae in the US and Sandostatin\u00ae LAR in the EU."
