"A. Yes, Vas, just to add, I think that really we were impressed by the very broad development program that BeiGene is running in global programs, having really 15 potentially registration-enabling trials ongoing. And I believe, for us, also advantage is that BeiGene has tested tislelizumab in very important indications in monotherapy that's different from spartalizumab, like non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer and so on. And therefore, we are excited to bring this product to market ex China."
