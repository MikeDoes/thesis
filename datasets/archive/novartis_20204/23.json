"I'll note a few. We expect the PARADISE post-AMI trial to read out in the first half of 2021. I already mentioned Cosentyx\u00ae in hidradenitis suppurativa. The Kisqali\u00ae MONALEESA-2 OS in the second half of '21. We'll see important mid-stage readouts for iptacopan in IgA nephropathy and C3G. We'll see also an important Phase IIb start for branaplam in Huntington's disease. And then, of course, the range of oncology milestones as well across the various oncology molecules. Important to note, in all of these projects, we have full teams working to accelerate them and working as fast as possible to maintain their progress through the pandemic and beyond. Particularly, we're looking forward to continue to advance our SHP2 inhibitor and our C-RAF inhibitor as well in the oncology portfolio."
