"Moving to Slide 28. I would like to give an outlook also on '21. We will continue to maximize our growth drivers, and we expect continued growth from Kisqali\u00ae. We are going to leverage the increased manufacturing capacity to drive further growth in Kymriah\u00ae. And for Lutathera\u00ae, we plan to unlock the potential in the community setting in the US and grow use in earlier lines. We expect also continued growth from our growth drivers, Revolade\u00ae/Promacta\u00ae, Jakavi\u00ae and Tafinlar\u00ae + Mekinist\u00ae."
