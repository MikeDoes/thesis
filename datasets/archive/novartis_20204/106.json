"Q. A couple of questions, please. Perhaps the first one I could take is on the SHP2, just if you could give us a bit of clarity in terms of timing, when we might see that first KRAS combination data. I know you've been in the clinic since Q2 last year with your partner in the US, Mirati. So just comment on timing and the degree of confidence you have based on the data you've presumably seen in house, that will have a major role to play in the future targeted lung therapy space."
