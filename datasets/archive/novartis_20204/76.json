"A. Yes. Thanks, Laura. So on Zolgensma\u00ae, what we ended up seeing in 2020 was newborn screening coverage in the US in the high 60s. And our goal is to get that into the high 80s over the course of 2021. And in that setting, we would expect, again, Zolgensma\u00ae to have a very high market share in states that have newborn screening. Alongside that, we also are working hard to get better \u2013 even further Medicaid coverage with hopefully getting a significant number of additional states fully putting in place Medicaid programs. So we haven't seen this as a significant barrier. We do think that will ease the ability to get patients started."
