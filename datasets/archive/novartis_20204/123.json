"Now there is some noise in the market around vaccination or delaying hesitation by HCPs on switching therapies, and that is a reality that we're seeing right now. However, what I can say is that we are currently running some clinical trials in vaccinations. We also have data in this regard, looking at other vaccinations in B-cell therapies and in other biologics that give us confidence that we'll be able to make sure that patients and physicians feel comfortable with using Kesimpta\u00ae regardless of COVID and regardless of vaccination. So there are currently a lot of real-world evidence databases that are quite encouraging. We're looking at this not only for Kesimpta\u00ae, but across the broad range of products, including Cosentyx\u00ae as well."
