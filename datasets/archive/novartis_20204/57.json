"And finally, on Slide 40, as currencies constantly change, I want to bring to your attention the estimated currency impact on our results using the current exchange rate. So if late January rates prevail for 2021, we would see a full year impact of currencies on sales around 3% to 4% positive and our core operating income 3% positive. For quarter 1, as you can see here, sales would be positive 4% and then core operating income of positive 2%. And as you know, we update these expected currency impacts every month on our website. With that, I hand back to Vas."
