"A. Thanks, Harry. On tislelizumab, broadly speaking, our goal is to maximize the value of this asset. We have an asset that can participate in the USD 50 billion-plus PD-1 market around the world. We have the full commercial flexibility to maximize the value of the product. And then our goal, of course, is to leverage the medicine across the full combinations possible across Novartis' oncology portfolio. So we have a number of combination studies already planned, and we believe having a hopefully soon-approved PD-1 in US and then later also in Europe will enable us to accelerate our own combination programs across the full range of our portfolio."
