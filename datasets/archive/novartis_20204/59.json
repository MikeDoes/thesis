"Just a final word on our ESG progress as a company. I think as many of you know, we've placed a high priority in being a leader in our sector on ESG across our 4 main areas of focus through our materiality assessment. Some of the highlights include the issuance of the first industry sustainability-linked bond for access to medicines. Our commitment for full carbon, plastic and water neutrality by 2030. We were just ranked today #2 in the Access to Medicines Index that was just announced and continue to see strong progress in our D&I and other corporate citizenship efforts. All of this has led to improvements in our ESG rankings, and we continue to work to being a leader in the ESG efforts across the sector in the years ahead."
