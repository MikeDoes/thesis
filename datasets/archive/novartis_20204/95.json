"With respect to Zolgensma\u00ae, I think historically, we've said that we're comfortable with the 2025 consensus, which I believe is in that range of USD 1.9 billion to USD 2 billion. And so that's the basis of the comment that I made. It's based on Zolgensma\u00ae IV and based on Zolgensma\u00ae IV in the current indications of under 2 years old in the US and up to 22 kilograms outside of the US. As I mentioned, we continue to work to get AVXS-101 IT fully licensed, and we'll give you an update once we clear the preclinical topic and finalize the Phase III development program."
