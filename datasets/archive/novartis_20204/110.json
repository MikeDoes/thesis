"A. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Emmanuel. On the SHP2 inhibitor, we've been working with Mirati. And we have a clinical collaboration in terms of moving forward. We've had a couple of patients in combination with their KRAS G12C, adagrasib. We're beginning to see the initial results. I think there was 1 case study that was presented at an oncology conference at the end of the year last year. We hope to reach proof-of-concept later this year and move forward based on those results. So the exact timing in terms of the Phase II and Phase IIIs will be forthcoming in probably the mid \u2013 this time, middle of this year is how we would move forward."
