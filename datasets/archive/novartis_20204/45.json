"Moving to Slide 29, just to give you an update on the recently announced deal to in-license tislelizumab from BeiGene. This is a late-stage PD-1 inhibitor specifically engineered to minimize binding to the Fc-gamma receptor on macrophages. Tislelizumab has 15 potentially registration-enabling clinical trials currently ongoing with first ex China filing expected in 2021. With this deal, Novartis obtains development and commercial rights on key markets, ex China, including US, Europe and Japan. It is a very attractive asset for us as we look to expand our presence in the checkpoint inhibitor space, and it provides us with an opportunity to launch a PD-1 sooner in broad and important indications such as lung cancer. We have identified also multiple potential combination opportunities with the Novartis portfolio across all of our 4 therapeutic platforms. So we are very excited about collaborating with BeiGene to bring tislelizumab to patients around the world. And we are looking forward to provide you with more updates after the transaction is closed later this year. And with that, I hand over to Harry."
