"So for the first half of 2021, we expect to continue to see challenges for certain therapeutic areas, such as dermatology and ophthalmology as well as in Sandoz retail. We expect that some of our new launches will be impacted, though we expect to continue to see solid progress, and you'll hear more about that from Marie-France, on preparing for these launches to accelerate in the back half of the year, such as Kesimpta\u00ae and Mayzent\u00ae. And we also know products that involve hospital initiation, such as Kymriah\u00ae, Lutathera\u00ae and Zolgensma\u00ae, will face a tougher situation in the first part of the year. Again, we would plan to overcome that in this period and then hopefully see acceleration in the second half of the year."
