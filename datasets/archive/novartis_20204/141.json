"A. Yes. Thanks, Kerry. On BeiGene, it does not change the status of our own PD-1. We view it as complementary. Our own PD-1 was primarily focused, spartalizumab, was focused on a few select indications. That was the strategy we took with that medicine. We'll continue on those indications. BeiGene has taken a very broad development program across the main PD-1 indications without overlap on spartalizumab. And so we're excited to bring that medicine to market across the full range of indications. Susanne, anything you'd want to add on this point?"
