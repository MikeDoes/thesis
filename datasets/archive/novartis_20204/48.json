"Now Slide 32 shows the summary of the performance for quarter 4 and full year. I will focus on the full year results on the right-hand side. Full year performance was solid, with sales growing 3% and both core operating income and core EPS growing 13%. Sales were, of course, mainly driven by Entresto\u00ae, Zolgensma\u00ae and Cosentyx\u00ae. Core operating income growth was driven by higher sales, some lower spend and significant productivity programs. Operating income grew 19%, driving net income growth of 20%. We will come back to the free cash flow number, which was USD 11.7 billion, a little later. Overall, clearly, a solid yearly performance, especially given the challenging business environment we are all in."
