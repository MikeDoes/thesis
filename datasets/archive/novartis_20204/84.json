"A. Yes. Thanks, Matthew. On the first point, our intention in Meet the Management was to provide confidence over the 5-year period and not to provide any sort of annual milestones with respect to consensus. So certainly, if that was misinterpreted, I apologize that we were not clear enough. I think what we did say is we plan to consistently grow sales and core operating income. We do that this year. We grew core operating income ahead of sales. We also have tried to be consistent that the margin progression will not be at a steady pace, but we will get to the high 30s as we outlined as well. So I think we're on track. Nothing fundamentally has changed. And when we look at that 4% growth out to 2025 and the margin out to rounded 38%, we feel very good with our ability to achieve that with the portfolio that we have in hand."
