"A. Thank you, Vas. So the AdComm discussion really reinforced the unmet need for Entresto\u00ae's value in the treatment of pEF. And we see this specifically in this group of patients with ejection fraction below normal. But it's difficult at this point to give you a specific range because that's going to depend on the addressable patient pool, which will obviously depend on the label. What I can say is that the total pEF population is about 3 million patients in the US and about 2 million of them have an ejection fraction below normal."
