"So moving to Slide 43. As we noted in our Meet the Management meeting in November, we're confident we will grow top and bottom line every year to 2025 and meet external expectations of 4% growth, reaching USD 60 billion in sales in 2025 and reaching the consensus margin of 37.6% in 2025. And we'll look forward to continuing to demonstrate our progress on this front as we move through the quarters ahead."
