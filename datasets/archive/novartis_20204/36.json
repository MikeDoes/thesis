"Due to the pandemic, some areas of our business, as mentioned by Vas, like the hospital-initiated therapies and specifically breast cancer therapies, continue to experience delays in new patient starts as well as concerns about patient management during COVID. But I have to say our teams really stepped out, and we leveraged our robust digital capabilities, and embarked on omnichannel launches for Tabrecta\u00ae in the US and Piqray\u00ae and Adakveo\u00ae in Europe, and are very pleased that this launch has continued gaining momentum despite limited face-to-face interactions with physicians."
