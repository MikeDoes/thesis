"Our best estimates over the course of last year were based on our discussions with the review team and our understanding that there were no safety, efficacy or CMC-related concerns that were product-specific. We ultimately all learned, and we did it as well with the CRL, that FDA wanted additional documentation and some additional control changes within this facility. It's notable this facility is approved in our European Medicines file, fully approved and part of the launch network for the launch of Leqvio\u00ae in Europe."
