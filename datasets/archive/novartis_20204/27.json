"Slide 17. Once again, Cosentyx\u00ae delivered double-digit growth and reached USD 4 billion for the full year. Our focus is on continuing to compete strongly to maintain our position in dermatology and accelerate in rheumatology. We know what we need to do to grow. We need to make sure we maintain broad access and balance that with the long-term value of Cosentyx\u00ae, and you can expect us to continue to do that. We'll expand into new geographies. In fact, we're now the only innovative biologic with broad NRDL listing in China. And we'll make sure that we're competitive in the marketplace with our industry-leading approach to data and presence as well as a number of new indications as we deliver on our ambitious life cycle management program. There is still tremendous opportunity in this market. And between the data, the access and our outstanding teams, we have what it takes for Cosentyx\u00ae to continue to grow."
