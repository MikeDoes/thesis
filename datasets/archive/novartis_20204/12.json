"Now moving to Slide 9. I also wanted to say a word regarding our performance in China. Now as you saw in our release, we were very pleased with our growth in China, with sales growing 16%, second-fastest amongst multinationals in China. Our goal is to double our sales in the country by 2024, making China the second-largest market for Novartis in the world. Our key growth drivers, similar to what we see in other geographies, are Entresto\u00ae, Cosentyx\u00ae as well as our other oncology strategic brands. What's very notable, I think, is the number of NRDL listings we achieved, we believe the highest in the industry in 2020. We also have a rich pipeline with 7 approvals expected in 2021. So taken together, we think we're on the right track to reach our goals in China and really continue to drive dynamic growth in this important market."
