This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Ellen. Our revenue of $21.5 billion in the second quarter underscores the great performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 25% in constant currency versus last year. Once again, the primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.\nI'm going to present to you in the following order: First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.\n\n Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $21.5 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and up 6% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $113 million, or $35 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 25% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially.\nOnce again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe, as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business relative to last year. U.S. revenue was up 25% year-over-year to $10 billion. U.K. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 20% year-over-year. These results do not reflect the movement in the British pound subsequent to the results of the referendum on June 23. Rest-of-world revenue was up 19% versus last year, to $9.6 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year.\nGAAP other cost of revenues were $4.2 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube; and hardware costs.\nGAAP operating expenses were $7.4 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.2 billion or 29% of revenue, up 15% year-over-year, and up 2% versus Q1. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to headcount growth. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 28%.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $7.5 billion, up 25% versus last year. The operating margin was 35%. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year, and up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased headcount and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years.\nHeadcount at the end of the quarter was 66,575, up 2,460 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud and Apps. On a numbers basis, we are adding more headcount in Google, while on a percentage basis, we are growing faster in Other Bets.\nOther income and expense was $151 million. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items impacted by market factors, which makes it inherently unpredictable. We provide more detail on these line items in our earnings press release.\nOur effective tax rate was 20%. Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.9 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.00 on a GAAP basis and $8.42 on a non-GAAP basis.\n\n Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.1 billion, with free cash flow of $7.0 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $78.5 billion, of which approximately $48 billion, or 61%, is held overseas. This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $21.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites' revenue was $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, and up 7% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and, increasingly, Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.\nNetwork revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional network businesses.\nOther revenue for Google was $2.2 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by Cloud and Apps as well as Play, followed by Hardware.\nFinally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are, of course, affected by currency movements.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $4.0 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 18% year-over-year, and up 5% sequentially. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly as a result of a mix shift between Sites revenue, which carries lower TAC, and network revenue. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.\nOperating income, excluding SBC, was $8.3 billion, up 26% versus last year, for an operating margin of 39%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 33% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7.0 billion, up 25% versus last year, and the operating margin was 33%.\nCapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, reflecting investments in product equipment, facilities, and data center construction.\n\n Turning to Other Bets financials. Let me again emphasize that the majority of these efforts are pre-revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities and are doing so in a disciplined way. We think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon, because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons: First, they are early stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And third, they may be impacted by one-time items, like partnership deals.\nFor the second quarter, Other Bets revenue was $185 million. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $709 million in the second quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $859 million. Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q2, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business.\nI'd like to close with a few observations on our key themes. First, regarding revenue. Our Alphabet structure announced nearly a year ago gives us a framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google and in Other Bets in a disciplined way. You have seen over the past few quarters how our focus on innovation can drive strong revenue growth. We're continually working to enhance the search experience and making changes to our ads formats and tools, guided by substantial user testing. We have repeatedly highlighted the 3Q15 change in format given the meaningful step-up it drove in our revenue growth rate. That benefit is evident again in the second quarter. As we have always said, we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation, but the timing and scale of the impact of innovation is inherently difficult to predict.\nSecond, as to expenses, I've commented many times that our focus on long-term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses. We invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue growth, with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas, secular trends are creating margin headwinds.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our Sites and network businesses.\nFor Sites TAC, there are a number of factors that contribute to fluctuations. In particular, changes in the relative use of mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. For each of these devices, Sites TAC also reflects an interrelated set of factors, including the mix of paid versus organic distribution points, partners, and agreement terms. Over the past year, the shift to mobile has been the primary driver of the increase in Sites TAC, because more mobile searches are subject to TAC.\nWhen looking at Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it is important also to remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our Sites line, the associated content acquisition costs are included in Other Costs of Revenues, not TAC. In addition, Sites revenue\n\n includes hedging gains with no associated effect on TAC.\nThe growth in network TAC is due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers which are subject to a higher TAC rate.\nIn operating expenses, people are our biggest area of investment. We continue to attract, develop, and retain the best people to drive our businesses forward. As you would expect, headcount additions primarily align with our priority areas, such as Cloud and Apps and machine learning.\nTwo important points regarding the third quarter. First, you will see the impact in the third quarter of our annual equity refresh for our employees. As you have seen in prior years, the annual refresh results in a sequential step up in SBC. Second, headcount growth tends to be seasonally high in Q3, because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season.\nThird, regarding CapEx, at Google, the team has been able to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable investment level. These efficiencies include improvements in power and server utilization, the use of machine learning, and deployment of innovations like our Tensor Processing Unit. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment continues to be the driver.\nFourth, about our balance sheet. We remain focused on optimizing our capital structure, recognizing the strategic value of our balance sheet. We completed Alphabet's $1.7 billion debt exchange in the second quarter, which gives us flexibility, including the ability to use debt financing if appropriate. In light of the interest rate environment, we may opportunistically access the market to term out our commercial paper.\nIn conclusion, in the second quarter, we delivered very strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency. These results reflect the tremendous talent and hard work of our teams around the globe. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: Thanks, Ruth. As you heard, we had a very strong second quarter. There is an amazing energy right now at Google. The strength of the quarter is about mobile. It's transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's products have become a central and much-loved part of their experience.\nOur investment in mobile now underlines everything that we do today, from Search and YouTube to Android and advertising. Mobile is the engine that drives our present. And now, through our deep investments in machine learning and AI, we are building the engine that will drive our future.\n\n Since the last earnings call, we had Google I/O, our biggest event of the year. And I also wrote our annual Founders' Letter. Both of these allowed me to reflect on our past and look to our future. We are at a pivotal and transformational moment. Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next ten years. In the letter, I wrote about how we think of our investments and our mission. Today, I'll walk through the six sections of the Founders' Letter and discuss our progress in each area, and then I'll call out three key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the future.\nThe first thing I highlighted in the Founders' Letter was information. At Google's core, we remain focused on making information and knowledge available for everyone. This, of course, starts with search, where we now have trillions of searches every year. We continue to invest in making search smarter and more useful.\nIn the U.S., we recently introduced a voter tool so when you search for \"Register to vote,\" you'll get a detailed state-by-state guide with information on how to register, requirements, and deadlines. Our new keyboard for iOS called Gboard is off to a great start. People love the ability to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type, and quickly send emojis. And after just one year, Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories.\nAt I/O, I was excited to share our vision around the Google Assistant. We want to help people get things done in a conversational way across devices and contexts. This is possible thanks to advances in machine learning, voice and image recognition, and natural language processing, which we have invested in for years. You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app Allo and our voice-activated device, Google Home. And we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area.\nSecond, machine learning. As I said, machine learning is the engine that will drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping users every day. In fact, more than 100 teams are currently using machine learning at Google, from Street View to Gmail to Voice Search and more. For example, in Search, we use a ranking signal called RankBrain, which relies on deep learning to improve results. It's already enhancing the search experience in 40 languages. And based on user testing, RankBrain can accurately guess which results users will favor with about 80% accuracy. Advances like this help us make our search results even more relevant.\nMachine learning is also creating an impact in other ways. Just last week, we announced a test that applied DeepMind's machine learning to our own Google data centers, resulting in up to a 40% reduction in the energy we use for cooling. This will greatly improve efficiency. And when we publish our research, we hope it will enable others to reduce emissions, too.\n\n Third, content. A big part of making information available is making great content accessible, such as on Google Play, YouTube, and the Web. Our efforts to make the mobile Web better for everyone with Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, has seen phenomenal global momentum. We now have over 150 million AMP pages in our index, and with over 4 million new ones published every week from nearly 200 countries.\nLast week, we announced AMP for Ads, which helps advertisers build fast, simple, and beautiful ads and landing pages. This will help make the mobile Web experience much faster for everyone and help fund it more sustainably.\nVideo is a huge component of digital content, and YouTube continues to shine. It's a thriving home for creators, with more than 1,000 creators crossing the thousand subscribers mark every single day. Our Content ID system has now paid out over $2 billion to partners who use the system.\nA big part of video, of course, is live, which we have invested in since 2011. YouTube is the first major platform that supports live content in 360 degrees, and we recently announced the ability for creators to go live from their phones with the touch of a button.\nEarlier in the quarter, we teamed up with BT to live-stream the Champions League and Europa League finals on YouTube in the U.K. This special event was the U.K.'s biggest-ever live stream. All these innovations are a big reason why partner revenue has averaged 50% growth over the last three years.\nFourth, platforms. A key focus is building great computing platforms like Chrome, Android, and our new virtual reality platform, Daydream, so that people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or screen they are using. Platforms are what make new computing experiences possible and also power breakout hits like Pokemon Go, which I suspect a few of you are playing right now.\nAndroid is thriving. In the last year alone, we have delivered over 65 billion app installs and are helping developers reach an audience of over one billion users every single month. Our partners are also seeing incredible success with flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S7. It's a hit with consumers and a shining example of how to build a great experience on Android. Our latest version of Android, called Nougat, focuses on performance, productivity, and security. And it also has a VR mode built in to help developers create immersive smartphone VR experiences.\nSpeaking of VR, we are already working with leading Android partners to build out the Daydream ecosystem. So stay tuned for more Daydream-ready phones, controllers, and headsets coming this fall.\nFifth, Cloud. Many tremendous digital experiences are being built in the cloud today, and\n\n businesses are working to take advantage of the cloud as part of the digital transformation. We've been integrating our Cloud and Apps products to create more unified solutions for companies large and small, and these efforts are paying off.\nWe have strong momentum with businesses like Symphony, a secure communication and workflow platform, who recently announced that its cloud computing business is available on the Google Cloud Platform. We provide the high reliability and performance needed by Symphony's customers in the financial services industry. Our data analytics product BigQuery helps mobile gaming company Kabam store and understand player actions within their games, from monetization and fraud to production bugs and level completion statistics.\nAs I've said, machine learning has been a major focus and a key differentiator for Google. And that's true for our Google Cloud customers as well. This quarter, we introduced Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which can deliver an order of magnitude better optimized performance per watt for machine learning projects. Google DeepMind's AlphaGo was powered by TPUs, enabling it to process faster and look farther ahead between moves. We are now passing this benefit on to our enterprise customers to supercharge their machine learning applications.\nJust last week, we introduced two Cloud Machine Learning APIs for speech and natural language to help our enterprise customers convert audio to text and easily understand the structure and sentiment of the text in a variety of languages.\nWe also introduced a new undersea cable system, the highest-capacity system ever built, which brings added capacity and performance to support our enterprise customers around the globe. This system has 60 terabytes per second of total capacity, more than any active undersea cable, and is ten million times faster than your cable modem. This is especially exciting as we prepare to launch a new Google Cloud Platform East Asia region in Tokyo later this year.\nIn addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are also hard at work building the best team to serve every aspect of our customers' businesses. We now have key leadership in place and centralized teams supporting customer-facing activities including sales, marketing, global alliances, industry solutions, and professional services. We are building out our support at full scale as more and more Fortune 100 companies choose our cloud.\nSixth, building for everyone. Since the Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, we are committed to building technology and making information available for everyone, wherever they are. This has always been core to Google's DNA.\nAs we have shared before, we are working with Indian Railways and RailTel to bring high-speed wireless access to the entire Internet to millions of people who travel throughout India's top railway stations. There are already two million people logging in every month, and they are using as much as 15 times the data they would otherwise use in a full day on their cellular\n\n networks.\nWe are also working hard to ensure that our products work well for everyone, regardless of where they live. We have been expanding direct carrier billing in Google Play, with more than 100 partners in 40 countries. To give you a sense of the impact, in Indonesia alone, we have seen growth in monthly buyers quadruple in the last 18 months.\nSwitching gears from these six areas, it's our business success that enables us and our partners to grow and invest further. We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we are already seeing strong growth in three key areas of our advertising business: Mobile search, video, and programmatic. All of the momentum you are seeing is because our products are doing well in mobile and our customers are getting great results from them.\nWe offer advertisers and agencies the best ways to reach customers at the right moment of intent, the best reach in inventory, the best mobile formats, and the leading measurement solutions. And, of course, we do all of this while making sure we are creating a great ads experience for users that's helpful and unobtrusive.\nWe know that people are constantly searching for things with commercial intent and are used to swiping and tapping. Our data shows that people respond really well to the ads we show. They are fresh, fast, and useful. So let me turn to three key moments from the quarter for our advertising business.\nNumber one, our Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers. We announced new expanded text ads and bid adjustments by device type, which are rolling out this week, as well as new local search ads in Google Maps.\nThanks to the rise of mobile phones, the line between online and offline experiences continues to blur. This creates even greater opportunity for businesses to use Google Maps to help bring customers into their physical store locations.\nThanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store, or downloading your app. For instance, Walgreens partnered closely with Google to promote their app across Search, Google Play, and our display networks. In one month, they increased the number of app downloads 87% from the previous month.\nNumber two, our annual Brandcast event for brand advertisers was a huge success. We announced breakout videos, the ability to advertise against fast-rising videos on YouTube, as well as a deal with the NBA to bring their inventory to Google Preferred. At this point, the volume of Google Preferred bought this year is already more than double what it was at the\n\n same time last year. Fast food chain Wendy's used Google Preferred to extend the reach of their TV ads. And thanks to our Brand Lift measurement solution, they were able to see that one of their campaigns drove an incredible 65% lift in ad recall and 146% lift in Google searches for the Wendy's brand.\nWe are hearing a lot of the same feedback from many top brands who continue to invest more and more of their budgets on YouTube.\nAnd number three, our DoubleClick Leadership Summit, held just last week for ad technology partners. We launched the ability to buy native ads programmatically across all screens in DoubleClick Bid Manager. Since they're providing fully designed creatives for each publisher, advertisers can simply upload the components of the ad, like headline, image, and text, and DoubleClick automatically assembles them to fit the context and format of the site or app where they appear. Making native advertising simple at this scale will help to make ads faster, better, and less intrusive while driving great returns for publishers.\nSo there's my top three moments from our advertising business this quarter. As you can see, it's been extremely busy.\nMore generally, from advertising to cloud to digital content to hardware and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google. Today's great innovations are being driven by investments in mobile. Tomorrow's will be driven from our investments in machine learning and new computing platforms. But one thing is constant: We'll continue to focus on building the best experiences for billions of people around the world. I want to thank all of the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help them bring to life for our users and partners. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat: Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star followed by the number one key on your Touch-Tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. And our first question comes from Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Kirjner, Bernstein: Thank you. I have two questions. First is about search revenues. I know Search is probably a $50 billion business, and from today's results, it's clearly still growing strongly. Of course, as the business gets larger, it becomes harder and harder to sustain growth. As you look at this increasing growth challenge on your product innovations in Search, including the recent changes and also those that you have in your road map for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenue growth and the trajectory over which they will ultimately decelerate?\n\n The second question is on Google Fiber. I think Ruth has been quite clear that we should expect an increase in Other Bets CapEx and that Fiber is the main driver, suggesting more investments. Yet when we see the rate in which you have deployed in markets like Austin or some of the newer markets, they are quite slow. You also have started to talk about wireless technologies, suggesting that you haven't fully figured this out yet, which in turn suggests that it's going to be slow deployment.\nSo the question is, which one is it? Is it faster, more aggressive deployment given the CapEx commentary? Or is it going to be continued slow, multi-year deployment, as your track record and the talk of new technology suggests? Thank you.\nRuth Porat: Thank you, Carlos. A lot in those questions. So starting with Sites revenue and where we see the opportunities there, obviously, Sites revenue up 24% year-over-year includes the currency impact. And as Sundar and I both commented on, the biggest driver, again, this quarter was mobile search. We do continue to have solid growth in desktop, tablet, and we have strength in YouTube, particularly video advertising, both in our TrueView products and increasingly from Google Preferred.\nAs we've talked about every quarter since the third quarter of last year, we have benefited from the change to ad formats on mobile that we made in the third quarter of last year. And that is evident yet again this quarter. You know, and then, as per your question, you know, when we go back -- going back to that third quarter of '15 when we made the change in ad formats on mobile, our growth rate meaningfully accelerated. And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change has been the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate.\nBut importantly, as you've seen over the last several quarters, we're benefiting not just from the higher growth rate, but also from the durability of the impact of the change. So that's really underscoring the efficacy of these ads for users, you know, as per Sundar's comments. And it's reflected in revenues running at a higher level. And you can see where the revenue growth rate was prior to the third quarter introduction. I'll let you do your own forecasting. But when comparing growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year.\nAnd then Sundar talked about some of the recent events that we've had. You know, innovation is core to everything we're doing. We've launched several changes to ad formats and tools just a few days ago. As the team discussed at the Google Performance Summit, we believe the changes should result in a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for advertisers. And so, you know, that just continues to be core to the way we're looking at the business, with a lot of incremental opportunity.\nAnd then on your Fiber -- Fiber and the CapEx question, you know, look, we continue to see Fiber as a huge market opportunity. We're focused on creating abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, as we've talked about. And we're continuing to\n\n work closely with cities, given their excitement.\nWe're also continuing to push the frontier with tech innovation, as you noted in your question, and different execution paths. So, you know, as you said in the question, we're exploring both Fiber and wireless. And you may have seen our recent acquisition of Webpass. So we want to make sure we're executing against a very large and attractive market in the most effective and efficient manner. We did start adding customers in Charlotte in July. And so, again, we view it as a big opportunity. We're being thoughtful and deliberate in our execution path.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan, UBS: Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe following up on Carlos's question on Search and, Ruth, your answer, I wanted to go a little deeper on the retail and the travel verticals. It's two areas where we see a lot of innovation from the company right now, both on the product side that consumers are seeing, as well as on the advertising side. How -- how should we think about the roadmap ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals, as well as the ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the company over the medium to long term?\nAnd then maybe one second question would be, with the buy-back authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, would love to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset and how shareholders should sort of think about the ability for shareholder returns over the medium and long term. Thank you so much.\nRuth Porat: Okay. So why don't I start on your second question, and then I'll pass it to Sundar on the first question. So, you know, as you know, we announced the share repurchase program relatively recently, it was just the third quarter of last year, and we just completed it, as per my opening comments. As we discussed back in the third quarter, we do always review our balance sheet and capital requirements and opportunities with our board. And I'm not going to speculate about a potential for a future board decision. So really nothing more to add at this point. And then Sundar?\nSundar Pichai: Look, I mean, we obviously think generally across, you know, all types of verticals, and you highlighted a couple of important verticals. To give an example, on travel, many users start their travel inquiry on Google. And so we focus on doing a better job of getting them, you know, deeper information, new destinations, and compare costs for new features in hotel search and Google flights and the recently launched Destinations on Google.\nIn all of this, we work closely with many different partners, including online travel agencies, and so we focus on product enhancements in partnership with them. And the better job we do at answering user queries, the more qualified leads we can provide to our partners. And we think it's a win-win arrangement. And the same concept applies to these other verticals as well. So,\n\n you know, we approach it very holistically.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you very much. Sundar, I was wondering, I know you gave us some color on the cloud business just a few moments ago in your prepared remarks. But I was wondering if you could share with us some of the changes, if you could highlight some of them that Diane has made since she's come on board. And I'm wondering how some of those changes might be starting to impact conversations with potential customers that you're having. And in particular, just trying to get a sense of, are you seeing Google now with GCP getting invited to more RFPs and starting to see your win rates go up as a result of some of her initiatives? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai: Thanks, Heather. Absolutely. You know, I think that Diane has initiated a set of changes, you know. And, essentially, she has integrated our go-to-market strategy with our engineering and product efforts. She has integrated our engineering efforts around the cloud. So, for example, Google Apps, Drive, Docs, Gmail, Slides, Sheets, Hangouts, et cetera, is on top of the cloud stack. Our enterprise customers and partners, you know, for them, now they have one enterprise face. And internally, from frictionless contracts, to touch points across Google, to one person to work with them on our considerable enterprise technologies and products, so the big unifying one being Cloud.\nWe now have new leadership in place across sales, professional services, marketing, and partnering, plus new customer-facing support in the form of professional services. We have an office of the CTO and customer reliability. So, you know, it's a big set of changes. And it's obviously having an impact. Many of our customers are also partners, and so it's increasingly clear how much we can do together.\nSo, you know, for me, I see a shift to a world-class enterprise approach. And it's definitely having an impact on the type of conversations we are having and the outcome of the RFPs we are engaged in.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you very much.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche\nBank. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Deutsche Bank): Great. Sundar, just had a question about machine learning. So you spent a lot of time talking about how this is positively impacting Google as a whole and how you're building for the future, both tonight and at I/O a few months ago. And you guys have mentioned things like reducing the error rates in search and improving relevancy. But are there tangible examples of either engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine\n\n learning in Search and in YouTube that you could share? And then I think Google recently introduced smart bidding in AdWords using machine learning. So do you see something like this as a potential revenue driver? Any color there would be great. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai: You know, so we definitely -- you know, a core part of improving the user experience for the next many years will be driven by machine learning. To give a specific example, you asked about YouTube, you know, YouTube watch time, you know, is something we focus on. We use machine learning increasingly to give recommendations to users of when they are watching a video in terms of what they could watch next. And that recommendation system is getting -- you know, increasingly using machine learning. And that directly drives engagement. So there are several such examples I can give across the company.\nYou mentioned AdWords, too. If you look at AdWords and, you know, the thoughtful changes we do, you know, over time, we are dealing with big combinatorial space in terms of the kinds of changes and interactions that can happen. So deploying machine learning there over time,\nover, you know, many years, you know, I think is a more powerful and deeper way to explore the various possibilities that exist and I think will lead to long-term impacts. And so I'm very optimistic on it.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nDouglas Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two. First, Sundar, you talked about expanded text ads. And my question was just, you know, as the number of characters here increases, some would say up to 50% through expanded text ads, you're taking up more space on the page, how do you balance the higher percentage of clicks from these paid ads with the natural search experience?\nAnd then, secondly, on YouTube, do you think you're taking share of TV dollars currently? And if not, what's needed to do that going forward? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai: You know, on the first one, you know, we obviously, you know, over many, many years, you know, we always put users first. And as we present our search results, you know, we -- you know, we have long-term metrics for user happiness around which we make -- you know, that's the framework for all the changes we make.\nYou know, obviously, with the shift to mobile, the user experience -- users are evolving in terms of how they use our product, and, you know, with that as a guidance, we have made changes. We make many, many changes. And I would look at it holistically. And, you know, even some\nof the changes you are talking about, you know, affect, you know, certain highly commercial queries where users are actually looking for that commercial information. So, you know, the metrics is what drives how we change these things. And, you know, we are very, very thoughtful about it. But we always step back and make sure that the overall, you know, load, et cetera, is\n\n really working for users. So I'm pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it.\nOn YouTube, you know, I think about it as -- you know, we are seeing, you know, strong growth. You know, I mentioned the momentum behind Google Preferred and how we are at double the rate we were last year. So to me, that implies, you know, strong growth. It's tough for us to assess whether it's from TV or just, you know, advertisers investing more because there's traction on YouTube. But, you know, we just see strong momentum. And, you know, as far as we -- you know, today -- when I just look at how users are using mobile, video is the killer app -- killer format on mobile. And I think that's what gives us the secular trend moving forward.\nDouglas Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thanks. I just want to ask one question, and it has to do with mobile search. And I want to throw an idea by you, which is, we've been going through this mobile transition for four or five years. Consumers have, I think, dramatically led businesses and advertisers to mobile devices. I'm wondering if what you're now seeing is finally, as eCommerce and travel and other commerce activities have really become critical and material on mobile devices, you're finally starting to see ad budgets really shift over and you're starting to get auction dynamics starting to pick up in mobile search. So if you could just comment on whether you're finally seeing this kind of back swing for advertisers to engage with mobile search in a way that you really hadn't seen before, it just took that many years for this to happen. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai: You know, I would -- Mark, thanks for the question. You know, I would say, at a higher level, you know, I mean, this is a scale business, and you're right, as we have had this shift to mobile, there are second-order effects which kick in, too, which is why, when you look at our ad improvements and our revenue improvements, I would focus more holistically. We do -- you know, we do deeper changes across the board, not just visible changes on the page. And all of that contributes to it. So, you know, I do definitely think as the shift to mobile accelerates, we are getting some scale benefits, and that's part of it.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I was wondering if you could spend a little time talking about the launch of the My Activities site, which I think is an update to the controls that your users have over the use of their data. And in particular, I'd be interested to hear about the option to opt into greater personalization of ads from across usership on Google sites, as I believe that's the first time you've allowed, on an opt-in basis certainly, to have search data be used to target ads elsewhere. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, what you're -- what you're seeing in terms of early traction in terms of users turning that on and what your\n\n expectations for that may be.\nSundar Pichai: Look, I mean, you know, we are -- you know, we are very focused on giving users better controls. And so we wanted to give users a single place to see and control ad settings. And that will be honored as the user moves across devices. It's completely opt in. Users are absolutely in control. And, you know, consumers and advertisers have come to expect the ads to work better across devices, and this new option could help us better deliver on that.\nSo for people who choose to opt in over time, we could make sure they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones. So, effectively, put them in better control of the experience we -- experience they get. And I think -- and so I think that helps the whole ecosystem work better. We are in very, very early days, but we are being thoughtful about how we do this for users.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert\nBaird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Great. Thanks. I guess two quick questions. First off, we understand that Google Shopping in particular continues to see strong growth. And I was hoping you could add some color on the relative mix or growth rates of PLA contrasting other ad types, along with the adoption of transactional capabilities. And then, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on some of the conversational and voice applications and devices that you have in the pipeline, and more generally, how you envision voice really fitting in across the board, across the Google platform. Will this be sort of a centerpiece as you also utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence? I'd like to, you know, hear more about your vision for that. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai: You know, let me, quickly, on the first one, we don't comment on the relative mix, et cetera. So I'll probably give more color on your second question. You know, voice is obviously very, very exciting for us. I mentioned this at I/O. You know, if you look at Android -- the Google app on Android, in the U.S., 20% of the queries are voice queries. So today, in terms of evolving to a conversational assistant, we have a big head start. People do this. We get millions of queries every single day. And it's incredibly exciting to see how people interact with voice, you know, differently from text. It's more intuitive. It's more personal, and, you\nknow, it's a bit more emotional and engaging experience for users. And so I think to do this well, you know, requires deep computer science, just understanding what they are saying, the natural language processing involved. These are areas in which we have now been working for over 15 years. And, you know, we believe we are the best-in-class. And so bringing all of that together I think is what will help us do this at scale globally. But it's still very early days in terms of getting the conversational assistant right. You will see us launch this throughout products as we go through the second half of this year. And I'm excited to see how users respond to it.\n\n Colin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Diclemente of\nNomura. Your line is now open.\nAnthony Diclemente (Nomura): Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, in terms of messaging, you mentioned Allo, your mobile messaging product, and Duo, which is your video messaging product. Why is it important that Google is competitive in mobile messaging? And what gives you the confidence that you could take market share from the other players in the messaging space?\nAnd then, Ruth, in terms of the drivers of YouTube growth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that one of the drivers was buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Just wanted to maybe hear a little bit more about that. Why has that been so successful recently? And do you look at that as an incremental forward driver of YouTube revenue growth? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai: You know, on your first question, you know, I think, you know, messaging is obviously an important area. You know, we approach these areas that we believe we have insights by which, you know, we can create something very differentiated for users, that we are actually approaching it in a new and unique way.\nThe core underlying insight we have is, in the context of mobile and using, you know, state-of-the-art machine learning, can we rethink some of these areas for our users. So that's the underlying framework with which we have approached this space. I've been really enjoying using these products, and we'll get it out to users soon.\nYou know, for example, I think if you take something like Duo today, I think especially on Android, you know, high-quality messaging is an experience that's still, you know, lacking for users. So we clearly see an opportunity there. And it's at the core of our mission, bringing informational experiences to users. And so that's why we are investing. And we are optimistic about this space.\nRuth Porat: And I think the -- and the other part of your question, I think the key point is, we've been talking about programmatic for quite some time. We're just seeing strong momentum, you know, across the board and continue to benefit from that.\nAnthony Diclemente (Nomura): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nBen Schachter (Macquarie): Sundar, can you broadly discuss the Google hardware strategy and perhaps some of the lessons learned from previous Google hardware launches? And then\n\n relatedly, can you discuss a little bit about how you're thinking about the auto strategy? Do you build your own vehicle's, license the technology? How do you determine which direction to take there? And how long until we might see any auto-related revenue? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai: You know, our overall hardware strategy, you know, we have always -- we have done devices like Nexus or Google Pixel, et cetera. We realize a lot of computing innovations happen at the intersection of hardware and software. And as we are building ecosystems and broad platforms, we need a way to drive them forward, and so that's the context in which we do. There are areas where we have done it very seriously, like Chromecast is a great example. You know, we now have over 30 million Chromecast devices sold. And, you know, that's an example of where we invest deeply. And especially as newer areas, like Google Home, we want our ability to put the best experience possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that's how we think about it.\nWe are being much more thoughtful in how we approach it and we are building a world-class team so that we can do this for our users. But, you know, we are very thoughtful about how we approach it, and we make sure to work with the ecosystem to accomplish what we are trying to do.\nRuth Porat: And then on cars, self-driving cars is in our Other Bets area, and so just a brief update there. We're now testing in four cities: Mountain View, Austin, most recently we expanded to Kirkland, Washington, and to Phoenix. We have self-driven over 1.6 million miles. And the focus here for us is we're solving a really big need, safety, access, and city efficiency.\nYou know, the thing that's really motivating for us is when you look at over 30,000 car deaths in the U.S. alone, you know, that's what really inspired the founders to start working on this issue. And our approach is quite different from most others. We're focused on fully autonomous cars because in early testing we saw the risk of depending on drivers to remain engaged once you give them the option to switch off. So we've invested a lot there.\nWe're testing extensively based on this approach. And, you know, more specifically to your question, we're pleased to be working with FCA to advance the development of the self-driving cars. With them, we're more than doubling the number of cars that we have. But we do have huge respect for the expertise required, so we do expect we'll work with many partners in this area.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (BofA-Merrill Lynch): Thank you. A couple questions. First, on YouTube, just thinking about premium content, a lot of activity with streaming deals out there. Obviously, YouTube would be a natural place for streaming content. But even professionally developed content. Do you think you're letting an opportunity get by? How do you think about that?\n\n And then, Ruth, I know you have a lot of experience dealing with regulatory agencies in your last CFO role. There's been some new filings. Can you talk at all about how Google is thinking about that right now? Thank you.\nRuth Porat: So I'll start on the second question. Look, we -- we continue to work constructively with regulators. We don't have an update on timing on any of the specific issues. But the main points, in our view, are areas that regulators have found that our businesses do help consumers. And the key mantra here is, if we do the right thing for the user, all else will follow.\nYou know, with respect to consumers, we continue to invest in innovative opportunities that create great experiences and improve their lives. And we're empowering small businesses globally by providing greater reach to customers not just in their towns, but across countries and around the world. You know, and in our discussions, one of the very important points is, we operate in a very vibrant, competitive environment. And we're also proud of the fact that we're investing meaningfully in the ecosystem. You know, for example, Android has helped foster a remarkable and sustainable ecosystem of manufacturers and app developers and entrepreneurs based on open source software and open innovation. And that's really kind of the thrust of it, is -- and the -- the emphasis is, we're continuing to work constructively with regulators. No additional update.\nSundar Pichai: And, Justin, on the live streaming question, you know, I already have mentioned that live stream is a big focus for us. You know, we've been at it for a while. And we've built a great, robust, and mature platform for big events. We just announced at VidCon our plans to make mobile live streaming features available within our core YouTube app on all mobile devices. You know, our stream time, live stream time, has increased 3X since the beginning of the year alone. And YouTube is the first major platform to support live content in 360 degrees. And, you know, recent examples, I'm -- even the RNC and the DNC conventions, they've been live streamed on YouTube in 360. And it's -- you know, so there's a lot of momentum there. And we are absolutely committed to the space.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the U.S. accelerated pretty nicely. Any specific buckets of advertisers or any of the innovative products that you'd call out as driving the acceleration in the quarter?\nThen the second one, Sundar, you talked about using machine learning for better suggestions on YouTube. Could you just help us at all think about what the level of engagement is on YouTube right now, whether it's minutes or maybe growth in minutes? How do we think about engagement on YouTube now? Thanks.\n\n Ruth Porat: So in terms of the U.S., what that -- the 25% year-on-year growth reflects strength across products. There's really nothing to call out. It's a modest acceleration consistent with what we saw overall. But it's really about mobile search.\nSundar Pichai: You know, on YouTube, you know, I would -- you know, at a high level, I would say we're not -- don't have any new metrics. But, you know, on mobile alone, you know, as I've said before, we reach more 18 to 34 and 18 to 49s than any other TV network, broadcast or cable. And, you know, every indication we see is that the growth is very, very strong, being driven by mobile. And it's growing globally as well. So overall, I think engagement is very, very healthy, and I'm pretty excited about it.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for\ntoday. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.\nEllen West: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2016 call.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.", "20163": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q3 2016 Earnings Call webcast.\nQ3 2016 Earnings Call October 27, 2016\nCandice (Operator): Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Q3 2016 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, head of investor relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP - Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you have been waiting for the call to start, you have been listening to Dua Lipa, a rising new pop star from London whose most recent single on YouTube has found fans all over the world and cracked the top 40 in the U.S. ahead of her debut album release early next year.\nNow I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our form 10K for 2015 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being Webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Ellen. Our revenue of $22.5 billion in the third quarter underscores the terrific performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 23% in constant currency versus last year, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Once again, the primary driver was mobile search with ongoing strength in YouTube, and important contributions from programmatic advertising and Play.\nI'm going to present to you in the following order. First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.\nBeginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance. Total revenue was $22.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. We realized a negative currency\n impact on our revenues year-over-year of $196 million, or $91 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially.\nAlphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $10.6 billion. U.K. revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, reflecting the meaningful impact of the decline in the British pound relative to last year.\nIn fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 18% year-over-year. Rest of world revenue was up 22% versus last year, to $9.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year-over-year.\nGAAP, other cost of revenues, was $4.5 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.2 billion, up 29% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.\nGAAP operating expenses were $8 billion in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.5 billion, up 13% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.8 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%.\nStock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion, up 30% year-over-year, and up 24% sequentially, primarily reflecting the step-up from our annual equity refresh for employees at the start of Q3. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 69,953, up 3,378 people from last quarter. Headcount growth is typically seasonally highest in the third quarter as new graduates join. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud.\nOther income and expense was $278 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 16%. Net income was $5.1 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.25 on a GAAP basis and $9.06 on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning now to capex and operating cash flow. Capex for the quarter was $2.6 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.8 billion with free cash flow of $7.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $83.1 billion, of which approximately $50 billion, or 60%, is held overseas.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment.\nRevenue was $22.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX.\nIn terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $16.1 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in mobile search. We continue to have decent growth from desktop and tablet search.\nYouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick bid manager.\n\n Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 1% year on year and flat sequentially, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional Network businesses.\nOther revenue for Google was $2.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year, and up 12% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by Play and Cloud.\nFinally, we provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $4.2 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 17% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas -- namely, mobile search and programmatic -- carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up slightly sequentially as a result of higher TAC for mobile search, offsetting the benefits of a revenue mix shift from Network to Sites.\nOperating income excluding SBC was $8.4 billion, up 19% versus last year for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 17% versus last year and the operating margin was 30%.\nCapex for the quarter was 2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.\nTurning to Other Bets, as we've said previously, we think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons. First, the Other Bets are early stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And finally, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals.\nFor the third quarter, Other Bets' revenue was $197 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $665 million in the third quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $865 million.\nOther Bets capex was $324 million in Q3, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business.\nI'd like to close with a few observations on our progress since the creation of Alphabet just over a year ago as well as a review of our key themes.\nAs we've frequently noted, our move to Alphabet was motivated by our belief that revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas. Long-term success requires a commitment to making bets, putting\n\n the right talent and resources behind those bets, and remaining flexible and dynamic as we pursue them.\nWe believe our structure provides the transparency and oversight needed to make smart choices about our investment opportunities, both within Google and across Other Bets.\nAs we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others. Over the past year, for example, you have seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas while repositioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.\nLooking ahead, first regarding revenue. Our revenue growth reflects our sustained investment in innovation. Within Google, this relentless focus has led to innovations across our advertising platforms that have driven continued strong growth on a very large base, while at the same time we're building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth.\nMost notably, Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity in this area.\nAnd earlier this month, we launched a new line of hardware devices that, for the first time, brings consumers the best of Google through both hardware and software developed by Google.\nAs discussed previously, because most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue, the Other Bets revenue line provides only partial insight regarding our progress which we aim to supplement with insight regarding product progress. For example, at Nest, product innovations and improvements including the new outdoor version of the Nest cam are leading to increased consumer adoption of its suite of products for the home.\nOur self-driving car team is making terrific progress in transforming mobility with our fleet of test cars recently passing the 2 million mile mark of autonomous driving. We are now testing our cars in four cities, enabling us to experience varied weather and driving conditions.\nSecond, as to expenses. As I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our Sites and Network businesses, and those factors persisted in the third quarter. The shift to mobile in Q3 remained the largest driver of the increase in Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue. We expect Sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of Sites revenue.\nThe growth in Network TAC in Q3 was due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate, a trend we expect to continue. Furthermore, with respect to Google's operating expenses, we remain committed to investing in the compelling opportunities we've identified.\nTurning to Other Bets. We're building out these businesses systematically and thoughtfully, investing commensurate with requirements given the opportunities we see.\n\n Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth quarter. As discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season. Relative to last year, we have an expanded portfolio of hardware products and, therefore, expect marketing costs to increase in the fourth quarter to support the line.\nThird, regarding capex. At Google, the team continues to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. With regard to capex investments for Other Bets, our fiber investment remains the primary driver.\nFourth, our balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains a powerful tool reflecting the strength of our cash flow, and thereby giving us the ability to invest aggressively to support our long-term growth. Our primary focus is just that, investing in the breadth of opportunities across Alphabet.\nAs discussed previously, our capital allocation framework begins with our outlook for the businesses, including a sensitivity analysis regarding potential capex and M&A, as well as a view regarding working capital and a prudent liquidity buffer. This framework further considers complementary uses such as a share repurchase. As announced today, our board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $7,019,340,976.83.\nIn conclusion, in the third quarter we again delivered strong revenue growth while broadening our portfolio of products and services. Thanks to all of our colleagues around the globe for their ingenuity and passion for pushing the frontier.\nI will now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google:\nThanks, Ruth.\nI don't think I can remember a busier time in Google's history than the past few months. We introduced the world to the Google Assistant, powered by our state of the art machine learning technology.\nWe unveiled a beautiful line-up of new hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel phone, which is getting great reviews. We launched a new messaging app, Allo, and a new video chat app, Duo. It's been an incredible quarter.\nThrough it all we are laser focused on the priorities I outlined earlier this year, and in the next few minutes, I'll quickly go through our progress this past quarter.\nWe feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing. This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistance and the Cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade from desktops to mobile devices.\n\n As we have rolled out products like the Google Assistant, Pixel, Google Home, and Allo, we have gotten a glimpse of that future. And with our growing Cloud business, we are helping our enterprise customers take advantage of this new era of computing as well.\nToday, I want to walk through our progress across Google's key focus areas and the success of our growing advertising business.\nFirst, making knowledge and information accessible to everyone. We have long aimed to help people find the information that they want right when they need it, and sometimes even before they think to ask for it. We reached an important milestone in the journey this quarter with the launch of Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural conversational way to help you get things done, regardless of the device you're using.\nWe first introduced it in our smart messaging app Allo which lets you chat with the Assistant. You can even add it to a group conversation to help you and your friends decide where to go for dinner. Early adoption of Allo and Duo has been great and has exceeded our expectations.\nAnd the Assistant is core to the Pixel phone and Google Home. With Google Home, you can ask the Assistant to cast a song to your living room speaker or turn on the lights in your kitchen. And with Pixel, by simply holding the home button, you can ask the Assistant to send a text to your mom or pull up pictures of your cat in Google Photos. I hope you all get to try them out soon. The Assistant is simple, easy to use, and it is just the beginning. It's going to get so much better. We are excited to bring new features to you across more of your contacts soon.\nThe Assistant is all possible thanks to our years of investments in computer science and machine learning. Our Knowledge Graph now understands our 70 billion facts about people, places and things in the real world. And just last month we announced our latest research on neural nets which has given us a huge leap in translation quality. This breakthrough will help us provide even more accurate translations for people around the world.\nAnd before I finish talking about access to information, I want to highlight the important work that our teams are doing to help American voters stay informed about the upcoming election.\nWe've launched improved search tools to help voters get registered, find key deadlines, and learn how to vote early or by mail. We launched these in both English and Spanish. I don't speak Spanish, but I checked Google translate and I want to remind everyone \u201cNo se olviden de votar.\u201d\nSecond, moving to our efforts to bring more content to more places. Key to making information accessible is helping people find more great content across platforms like the Web, YouTube, and Google Play. Just recently, one of our key efforts to make the mobile Web faster, the open source project AMP, celebrated its first birthday. It's been embraced by a very broad range of publishers and sites around the world, covering more than 700,000 domains. One example, tens of millions of WordPress sites now have AMP pages with page load speeds up to 90% faster than normal in some cases. We're also working on an initiative called AMP for Ads, a new approach to creating and serving ads with speed at the heart of the experience.\n\n On YouTube, we continue to invest in bringing engaging content to the platform. We worked with many news organizations to livestream all three U.S. presidential debates, and we saw record-breaking interest from the YouTube community. In fact, the three debates rank as the three most viewed political live streams of all time on YouTube with over 8.5 million hours watched live, a 5x increase from the 2012 debates.\nElection related searches on YouTube are also at an all-time high, with searches for U.S. election content up almost 550% compared to this time in the last election. And YouTube Originals, like the recently released Single By 30, remain incredibly popular and continue to drive subscriptions for YouTube Red. And in Google Play, earlier this summer we introduced Family Library, a way for up to six family members to share app, game, movie, TV show, or book purchases.\nThird, powerful computing platforms and hardware. We have long been committed to building powerful computing platforms like Android, Chrome, and now Daydream in VR, so that people can have great experiences regardless of their device.\nTaking a step back, we have always believed that an open, horizontal free platform like Android breeds more innovation, more options for users and better business models for partners. We opensource our code, we build the most open APIs possible, and we work to create a sustainable, open ecosystem. With over 4,000 distinct Android devices, we are really proud of how so many partners are having success on the platform.\nThis quarter we began rolling out our newest update on Android called Nougat and shared that we are bringing Android apps to Chromebooks. We can't wait to see all of the incredible experiences that developers will build on Daydream, our newest platform for high-quality virtual reality experiences via smartphones. We also think there is an opportunity for us to more deeply integrate software and hardware together to deliver great experiences that we hope will also contribute to future innovation and development of the ecosystem.\nEarlier this month, we launched a family of hardware products Made by Google, which, in addition to the Google Pixel and Google Home, include the Daydream View headset and controller; our premium TV-streaming device, Chromecast Ultra; and a new connected Wi-Fi system called Google Wi-Fi. This portfolio of products is an example of how we can marry the best of hardware and software to deliver the best Google experience to people.\nFourth, our increasing momentum in Cloud. As we focus our efforts in the Cloud, we continue to see strong customer engagement. Last month at our Horizon event we introduced a new business unit, Google Cloud, our unique and broad portfolio of products and services that let our customers operate easily in a digital world at the performance they demand.\nGoogle Cloud includes Google Cloud Platform, our user-facing collaboration and productivity applications now called G Suite, all of our data analytics and machine-learning tools and APIs, and the enterprise-ready Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks that access the Cloud.\n\n Our Cloud team has also been busy delivering new capabilities for our customers. We announced plans to expand to eight new Cloud regions in 2017, from Mumbai to Singapore to Sao Paulo to Frankfurt, with more to come.\nWe announced an enhanced video conference experience in Google Hangouts with an updated user interface, instant screen sharing, support for 50 participants, and a seamless integration into calendar. We've been using the same technology to power meetings at Google and are so excited to share the improved experience with our customers.\nWe also significantly upgraded Google BigQuery, our fully managed data analytics warehouse, and made Google Cloud machine learning available in beta to help businesses easily train quality machine-learning models.\nIn addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are partnering with great companies. This quarter, we forged new partnerships with Okta, Box, and Accenture.\nOur investments in machine learning continue to be a very clear advantage for Google Cloud, and we are helping customers apply ML in very concrete ways. For example, Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer, is using machine learning to categorize and prioritize customer emails which will help their support center respond to customers faster.\nAs we officially move into the Google Cloud era, our goal remains the same. We want to build a most open Cloud for all businesses and make it easy for them to build and run great software. The team is firing on all cylinders to create the best Cloud products in the industry for our customers.\nNow moving on to growing advertising business, which is thriving in a mobile world. Our proposition to marketers on mobile is simple and is resonating. Our mobile properties, like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play, are where people turn when they are actively interested in something. They are using our services because they want to actively watch something they are passionate about, or because they want to know, go, do, or buy something. They are super attentive and engaged. It's just like people used to be glued to their TV screen during primetime. Our services are primetime for the mobile world.\nThis matters for marketers because those prime time moments when people are actively interested and attentive are the perfect time for a brand to place their ads. For instance, hotel chain La Quinta now sees a third of their website traffic coming from mobile, and they use their hotel ads to help them reach travelers right when they are looking for hotel stays. They found conversion rates to be twice as high with Hotel Ads compared to regular mobile traffic, which is helping them capitalize on those primetime moments when travelers are on their phones and ready to book.\nIn video, YouTube continues to shine. More than a billion monthly users are watching hundreds of millions of hours every single day. YouTube has become the platform of choice for major brands, with a highly engaged audience, the best formats, and industry-leading measurement tools. Recent research found that nearly half of U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 54 say that at least once a\n\n month YouTube helps them in making a decision about buying something.\nOne format that's been working really well for advertisers are Bumper ads, which are snackable, six-second videos that help brands drive incremental reach and frequency. Brands like Universal Pictures have been pairing these shorter videos with their standard length ads on YouTube and they are seeing great results, especially on mobile.\nWe also recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase Google and YouTube searches for their brand. From early tests, we have seen that YouTube generates almost twice as many searches per impression than TV generates. In fact, across our advertising business, measurement is a critical investment. We want to give marketers the best tools out there to close the loop between television and digital, online and offline.\nFor example, global retailer IKEA, with their agency iProspect UK, used our store visits measurement tool to see how effective their digital marketing campaigns were at bringing shoppers into their stores. By incorporating store visit data, they realized that more than 10% of the people who clicked on their search ads went on to visit a physical store, and that their ROI from online ads was actually five times higher than they had previously estimated.\nWe introduced even more measurement solutions at this year's Advertising Week in New York, helping marketers close the loop with new tools like location extensions and store visits measurements for the Google Display Network.\nWe have thousands of great partners who are getting terrific results from our products. I'm really pleased with how our business teams are working closer than ever with our advertising partners, agencies, marketers, and publishers. We can't succeed unless they do, and we have made a huge push to develop deeper partnerships and long-term win-win relationships. It's a big focus for us.\nTo wrap up, it's been an incredibly exciting few months and a very successful quarter. We feel extremely confident as we move into a new era of computing and are thrilled to be working with our partners as we embark on the journey together.\nI want to thank all of the Googlers around the world who worked tirelessly to turn ideas into reality for our users and partners. It's an honor to work alongside you every day. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star followed by the number 1 key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. Again, to ask a question at this time, please press star 1. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you so much for taking the question. Sundar maybe for you, on the\n\n enterprise, thanks for laying out all the vision for the medium to long term on enterprise and Cloud. I think one of the big questions we get from investors all the time are where are the key areas you need to invest going forward in both capabilities to go to market and how those might evolve over the next couple of years.\nAnd then maybe a second question for Ruth, which more housekeeping matter. Ruth, with highlighting the increased marketing expense on the product launches this year, were you referencing quarter-over-quarter or compared year-over-year when you also launched products a year ago? Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: You know, on Cloud, let me talk about a few areas. You know, we have stepped up our partnering considerably so that we can offer our customers everything they want, and we have more vehicles for going to market. So scaling up through partnerships is a big area of focus and investment for us. We are also establishing a large Cloud machine learning group so that we can take advantages of working with our Cloud customers and make machine learning more accessible to all of them. I would say other areas are hiring across sales, engineering, and marketing. And as we head into 2017, I expect Cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and headcount growth.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: And then on your second question, there are really two parts to the statement. One, pretty obvious, is that sales and marketing is seasonally higher whenever we go into the holiday season, and so year-on-year, I wanted just to accentuate the point that we expect this trend to be pronounced this year because we're expanding -- we're launching an even more expanded suite of hardware products. So it's really emphasizing the fact that the fourth quarter is higher, and even more so this year with the expanded suite.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman\nSachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you. Yes, I also wanted to ask a follow-up on the Cloud. I guess I was wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us kind of what milestones should we be watching for in this business? And then also, if you had to characterize -- you mentioned a couple different ones, but I'm wondering what type of workloads are you having the most success with in GCP and kind of what's on your customers' wish list? What are the things -- What's the top one or two things that your enterprise customers for Cloud might be asking for? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: Thanks, Heather. In general, you know, like, the way we see is that customers don't want to be locked in, and they want to make sure their workloads can work in and be managed by containers that run on any platform. So, you know, our virtual machines and containers, including, you know, excellent open sourced container management Kubernetes, which was developed by Google, offers that solution. So Kubernetes manages the provisioning, reliability and auto-scaling of workloads. So we want to pursue a hybrid strategy, including on prem, and in all public Clouds. So from a customer standpoint, they will want to use an open-source workload\n\n management product, and Kubernetes can work with multiple customers. So that's broadly how we -- how we think about it.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Deutsche Bank): Thanks, guys. Two questions. Sundar, first on the Alphabet kind of structure, high level. So there's been some incredible innovation that's come out of Alphabet, the various businesses, but if we look at something like Otto, which was acquired by Uber, or Niantic, which was the old Google Maps team, those were teams that were inside of Google that left Alphabet to start a new company and could have been, potentially, wholly-owned businesses of Google in a parallel universe. So do you think this structure is ideal for entire companies or is it just new products and new technologies that you see as the vision here for Alphabet long term? And then, Ruth, the second question, just on core operating margins for Google declined a little bit versus the prior quarter trend of increasing. Can you just give us some color on how much of that was due to mix towards Cloud and other things that might carry lower margin versus margin compression within the advertising business? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: Ross, on the first question, you know I would say, overall, when I look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we've been able to build, you know, world class products and achieve scale and success, we today have over seven products which serve a billion users each. So I think our track record speaks there. And we generally want to encourage a culture of innovation, and that's what we focus on, and I think it is fine that some of them happen outside. So we don't view it as a zero sum game and we are very comfortable with how we approach it.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of the margin trends, so overall, operating margins year-on-year are up modestly on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and that primarily reflects trends in Other Bets. I think your question was probably more within Google. The operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is down modestly year-on-year. That's primarily to other cost of sales as distinct from TAC.\nThe Google GAAP operating margins year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter do reflect the impact of the equity refresh that we called out last quarter that I talked about. I think one of the core things to your question is just is how we're looking at it, and our view continues to be that given the breadth of opportunities and our commitment to long-term revenue growth as we've talked about, quarter after quarter we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of opportunities, and we spend a lot of time trying to manage, you know, that revenue growth and, as I've said, manage expense growth with kind of the utmost respect for the resources deployed in getting the best return on those resources.\nSo there are a number of different factors in here. I think I mentioned one of the things as you're looking forward was the sales and marketing. And just to make another point, which I said in my opening comments, we do expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with mobile search and with programmatic. That does still result in more revenue and gross profit dollars\n\n but at a lower margin, and that's the other really important point with, you know, our starting point. We are continuing to invest, and we will point to the revenue and the gross profit dollars that come from that.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thanks, with the Google Home and the Pixel phones, are you rethinking at all your go-to-market strategy in terms of distribution and marketing? Google over the years has put out different hardware products. Have there been learnings from that that make you approach those two particular areas in Google Home and the Pixel phone line-up differently? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: Thanks, Mark. And as you point out, we've done hardware products over the years, but, you know, we saw an opportunity to bring all our disparate hardware efforts together in a thoughtful structure. I'm glad Rick is here, and we have been very focused on how we approach everything end-to-end so that we can bring together software and hardware for a great user experience. So along those lines, both Google Home and Google Pixel are important new efforts for us, and I think we will thoughtfully evolve our go-to-market strategy as well. These are important areas, and you already see with the Google Pixel, we have a deep partnership with Verizon, with which we are going to market in the U.S. And so we are constantly thinking about how to do this well, and you will see new approaches as we go through it more.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JPM): Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you talked about a lot of products across advertising and hardware. I think one thing we did not hear about was Maps, and I think you talked about it in the past as a billion-plus users and pretty massive engagement. So can you talk a little bit more about the monetization strategy here and how you can, you know, really sell more advertising here but also preserve the user experience at the same time and maybe talk about kind of the time frame that we could see more here? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: That's a good question. I mean, today, you know, a big part of -- you know, part of what you're seeing with our, you know, transition to mobile that's working really well, you know, the reason mobile search and mobile monetization works really well for us is because a lot of it is inherently local by nature. And the thing which helps us deliver a great local search experience is Maps, and so that's the direction we've always pointed in. We want it to be a great experience for consumers as Google Maps, but in terms of also, you know, really enhancing the local search experience. And I think you'll continue to see us pursue it that way. And over time, to the extent there are opportunities to create value within the application itself, we'll pursue that as well.\n\n Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nPeter Stabler (Wells Fargo): Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about Voice. Sundar, you talked about the success you've had in improving your natural language recognition, and we know that voice queries are growing quickly. I'm wondering if you can share your thoughts on how the increase in voice queries may or may not impact monetization going forward. Is it a risk or is the growth of voice queries much more skewed to less commercial activity? Just any thoughts there. Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: Thanks, Peter. You know, from my standpoint, I look at it as, you know -- and if you look back in time, all this is -- you know, computing is becoming more and more important to people and so they are engaging with it more and more. So as we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other. The sum total of all of this, you know, it expanded the pie. I approach this the same way. I think as I see people using Voice, et cetera, they are interacting more with computing and with Google -- Google, too. So we view this as providing users more access across many different surfaces, many different contexts, being there for them when they need it. So in that -- in that view, I think it will all be a big positive for us, you know, going forward.\nPeter Stabler (Wells Fargo): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just to go back to the voice search question, Sundar can you talk a little bit about if we do continue to migrate toward a world of voice search, just talk about infrastructure, potential building you need to put in place to kind of continue to monetize search in a voice world as well as you do in a phone or a desktop world. And then, secondly, could you just talk a little bit about where you are in the rollout of expanded text ads? I know you talked about a 20% bump to click-through rates. I'm just curious where you are now, kind of a pushout and is there any update on the click-throughs? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: On the first question, I think I briefly answered it before. In terms of, you know, we are thinking about the voice experience deeply end-to-end. You know, a lot of it is going -- you know, because of how we are approaching, you know, our core investments, both from a software and hardware standpoint. So we leverage it all to make it better. You know, so, for example, you know, even things like TPUs, which we talked about Google I/O, play a role into something like voice search you're talking about. And as we evolve the Google Assistant, I think Voice is going to play a major role that way as well. So we are in the very early days of all of this in relation to our overall volumes we see, and so I think we will be thoughtful about it. For example, the Assistant team talked about, you know, conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the Voice experience.\n\n So it's early days. And I think we'll evolve it a lot in the coming years. In terms of your second question around expanded text ads, you know, I would say, again, it's early. It's being adopted by advertisers across the board. We see both large and small advertisers using. For us, we find advertisers who actually spend their time being thoughtful about the ad creatives and extensively testing and optimizing for this new format. They find strong performance. So we're pleased with the progress so far, but the transition is going to take some time as advertisers get comfortable with it. But we are excited about it.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of\nNomura. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Nomura): Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First one for Ruth. Heading into this quarter's results, you had called out the ad format change in the third quarter of last year, which had driven a step up in the year ago growth rate. I wonder, is there anything specific on the revenue side that you'd like to call out in terms of comparisons versus the fourth quarter of last year as we try to calibrate our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter, either in terms of mobile search, YouTube, or ad tech programmatic?\nAnd then my second question is either for Ruth or Sundar. Can you just talk about the decision to pause efforts for Google Fiber. I'm wondering, was that decision more about financial discipline as you, I think, explained, Ruth, in your prepared remarks for the Other Bets or does it more have to do with the shift to wireless internet technology or point-to-point wireless which ultimately can take the place of a fiber or facilities-based infrastructure over time? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: Okay. Great. Two good questions. So in terms of Sites revenue, we are very pleased by the strength. It was broad based. It had two real drivers. First, you know, our ongoing focus on improving the experience for advertisers and users. And we introduced a number of enhancements, including format changes and ad tools. I think the most important point is that no one enhancement came close to the magnitude of the changes that we made in the third quarter of last year. You know, that's why we kept calling out the 2015 change, and what's been gratifying is in the aggregate, the results reflect the benefit of ongoing innovation. But, you know, very importantly, it wasn't one particular item.\nThe second contributor is the secular shift to mobile, and we continue to benefit from that, be an important part of enhancing opportunities for engagement. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, I think that was part of your question as well. You know, I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year. So just that, to us, is an important point to -- maybe obvious, but important to note there.\nYou know, in terms of Fiber, the impetus for it was really about the opportunities that we see to focus on innovation and what does that mean if the objective with Other Bets is really these 10x opportunities. And when you go back to the initial impetus for creating the business, it was the Founders' view that there's a sizeable opportunity given the need for abundant connectivity on\n\n networks that are always fast and always open, and we do continue to be committed to that vision.\nThe team had some important breakthroughs in new technologies. You noted the most important in our view, all that we're doing with wireless, but also technologies that are key to implementation, and we believe that both of those -- you know, a number things they're doing enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency. And so we wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we re-accelerate deployment. And it was about ensuring that we can take advantage of those before, again, pushing forth.\nWe are very active in a lot of cities. In the third quarter alone we rolled out four new cities, so that brings us to twelve cities across the U.S. where we are deployed, in construction or development, and we're making great progress in those cities. We remain very committed to growth across those cities. And then we also have a presence in six cities with our wireless acquisition Webpass.\nSo we're pausing for now our work in eight cities where we have been in exploratory discussions, but very much to your question, it's to better integrate some of the technology work we have been developing. And, you know, there's more detail on the cities on the Fiber site to the extent you want to go into those.\nAnthony DiClemente (Nomura): Great. Thanks, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.\nYour line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you very much. So, Sundar, it seems like from the outside looking in, the pace of product development and release seems to have accelerated while at the same time it seems like you're gaining efficiencies with the assets you are deploying to run your business and as your capex growth is moderating. So I'm wondering what concrete steps you may have taken to increase productivity or focus at the company and what you are doing now to continue to drive those gains going forward.\nAnd separately, as you called out earlier, you are shipping an unprecedented amount of hardware devices. So as you think about what your portfolio, product portfolio might look like over the next five years or even the next decade, has the Pixel phone marked a change in direction for Google to become maybe more of an integrated software and hardware company? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: Thanks, Stephen. On the first thing, I would say, you know, we are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that, you know, in a unique way, thanks to what we view as a point of inflection with machine learning. So refocusing the company on a set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection is what has helped us really focus on things. And, you know, things like the Google Assistant are a manifestation of that, and you will see us continue to stay focused and innovate, innovate that way.\nIn terms of hardware, you know, I think -- you know, in our vision, computing is becoming more and more integral. It's going to be there for users in many different contexts. And so to really think and\n\n evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together. That's where a lot of innovations happen. And so for us to push the paradigm, push the boundary, we're very committed to doing that.\nSo it's a thoughtful effort from us, but overall, as I said in my remarks, we deeply remain committed to building an open ecosystem because at the end of the day, we want Google to be there for every user everywhere. And to do that well, we want to work with partners and build a great ecosystem to make it happen.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: And just to add a bit more to Sundar's first answer, first response to your question about efficiency and as it's expressed through capex spend. I think it's probably helpful to add, you know, the pace of spend reflects the ongoing success of the team driving meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, and that's enabled us to support growing demand but at the stable investment level. We've talked about that on prior calls as well. But I think we're proud of what they have been doing there.\nSome examples of efficiencies include improvements in server utilization and the use of machine learning that Sundar has talked about, and the deployment of innovations like our Tensor Processing Units that he's commented.\nSo the main thing is we're building greater productivity with existing machines. And what's important to note is that's not only good for Google products generally but it's also valuable to our Cloud offering for our enterprise customers.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you and our next question comes from Ken Sena from Evercore SI.\nYour line is now open.\nKen Sena (Evercore): Thank you. Sundar, you mentioned a point of inflection within machine learning. Can you talk a bit more about the tradeoffs in the productization and sale of that inflection through Google Cloud versus leveraging that innovation yourself through Google Assistant.\nAnd maybe for Ruth, any thoughts on potential future disclosures around the Cloud business? That would be great. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: On -- On the first one, look, I mean, I think we are -- I mean, this is -- you know, it's a big platform shift, and, you know, it has to be available for everyone. So, you know, we've always, just like we have done with things like Android, when we see platform shifts, you know, we provide Android to everyone. So, you know, that's the way we think about Google Cloud. We want to make sure that the -- this -- that all these new capabilities for machine learning and AI are available through Google Cloud to all our partners. We don't see it as a zero sum game. I think, internally, core to our mission, we see areas where we can execute, and we will continue to do that. But, you know, we want to do both, and we can do it thoughtfully well.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: And then on your second question, you know, we\n\n constantly look to assess, you know, if or when additional data makes sense, given specific performance. And when we went through the third quarter results, that was -- has been our intent with all of the color commentary, you know, on Cloud. I guess the only other thing to add is the largest percentage growth year-on-year in our Other revenue line, and actually even across all of our revenue lines, was in our Google Cloud platform and that reflects the significant momentum in compute and storage.\nKen Sena (Evercore): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.\nYour line is now open.\nJustin Post (BofA-Merrill Lynch): Great; thank you. Sundar, I apologize if I missed it, but could you talk about machine learning in Search and how much it's making a difference over the last few quarters and how much you still have to go, how important that is to the revenues.\nAnd Ruth, a couple questions. Any thoughts on whether hardware sales can make a difference to margins going forward? And also on the stock-based comp, how Google thinks about that expense internally. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: You know, on machine learning in areas like Search and even ads, you know, on Search we've had an effort called Rank Brain which is bringing Google Brain in the context of Search, and we made great progress on it but I would still -- you know, I would characterize it as very early stages in terms of the long-term impact we can have.\nAnd generally, and similarly, we are in very, very early stages of incorporating machine learning, the newer machine learning systems in ads and again, that's the beginning of a long journey as well.\nOverall, I think all of these systems are, you know, incredibly complex systems, you know, and they are hand-crafted systems over many, many years. Any, you know, so over time, I think machine learning will surface newer approaches and newer insights, and so we see it as a huge area of opportunity, but it will play out over -- over a period of time.\nRuth Porat, CFO - Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of the hardware family, I think Sundar has given a lot of color on that. It's still early days with rollout of some of these newer lines that we're super excited about, and so early to make a call on that, but certainly investing meaningfully in the line given the importance we see in this.\nAnd then in terms of stock-based compensation, you know, we've always said we're going to remain focused on long-term revenue growth and that does require investing in talent, and we do believe equity ownership is a really valuable part of overall compensation consistent with alignment of interest. It's something we keep an eye on, and we're mindful of the full cost of equity-based compensation and certainly look at that as the part of the overall cost that we're investing in in and across the businesses.\n\nJustin Post (BofA-Merrill Lynch): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital\nMarkets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, last month, Google was part of the founding group the Partnership for AI. And I was just curious to hear your thoughts on what your goals are for the group and how you may take lessons back to your leadership at Google. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO - Google: Look, I think, you know, I'm very, very glad to see the group come together. You know, we are in extraordinarily early days for AI, and it's super important that we approach it thoughtfully as an industry. I am encouraged to see the commitment across these companies. You know, our goal is to promote open collaboration, help the public understand AI and establish best practices in R&D, you know. Without something like this, I think ideas would develop in silos. So I think it's good to do this to promote and inform dialogue on AI.\nAnd so I am pretty excited. You know, all along, just like with TensorFlow where we are doing this in an open way, and all the other things that we have done at Google, I think it's important as we work on new technology to contribute and to give back. And so in that context, I think all of this is personally very meaningful to me.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Thanks, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\nwould like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any further remarks.\nEllen West, VP - Investor Relations: Thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2016 call. Thank you and have a good day.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.", "20164": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q4 2016 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q4 2016 Earnings Call January 26, 2017\nCandice (Operator): Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, the participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. As a reminder today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you\u2019ve been waiting for the call to start, you\u2019ve been listening to Ingrid Michaelson. In just a decade she has released six albums, five of which have charted. The song you just heard, \"Celebrate,\" is from her latest release titled \"It Doesn't Have to Make Sense.\" Please check out her YouTube channel.\nNow I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.\nThese statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC.\nAny forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release.\nAs you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.\n\n Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you. Our revenue of $26.1 billion in the fourth quarter underscores the continued excellent performance of our businesses globally. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 24% in constant currency versus 4Q '15, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison.\nAdvertising revenue growth was driven by mobile search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in Other Revenues from Hardware, Play and Cloud.\nOur outline for today's call is: first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I'll focus on year-over-year changes in our results. You can find quarterly comparisons in the earnings release. Second, I'll review the results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with a summary of the full-year results and our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.\nLet me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenue was $26.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $202 million or $15 million after the benefit of our hedging program.\nHolding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenue grew 24% year-over-year.\nAlphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $12.7 billion. U.K. revenue was up 7% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, reflecting the continued weakness of the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 21% year-over-year. Rest of World revenue was up 24% versus last year to $11.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year.\nGAAP other cost of revenues was $5.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses; specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, as well as Hardware.\nThe impact of our Q4 Hardware launches is reflected in both revenues and cost of revenues. However, it's important to note that cost of revenues was also affected by approximately $320 million of one-time charges related to equipment and other adjustments which were unrelated to Hardware.\nGAAP operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the impact of the expenses from project milestones in Other Bets in 4Q '15 that we discussed last year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last\n\n year. The operating margin was 25%.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 33%.\nStock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year.\nHeadcount at the end of the quarter was just over 72,000, up 2,100 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud, including the addition of employees from our Apigee acquisition.\nOther Income and Expense was $218 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.\nOur effective tax rate was 22% for the fourth quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete items affecting our U.S. rate. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 was 19%.\nNet income was $5.3 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.56 on a GAAP basis and $9.36 on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning now to capex and operating cash flow, cash capex for the quarter was $3.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.4 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $86.3 billion, of which approximately $52 billion, or 61%, is held overseas.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $25.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $18 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year.\nYear-on-year growth reflects strength in mobile search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, including buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.\nNetwork revenue was $4.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses.\nOther Revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year-over-year, with strong performance from each of Hardware, Play and Cloud.\nFinally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume 3\n\n dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $4.8 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue and up 20% year-over-year.\nThe increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas -- namely, mobile search and programmatic -- carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was up as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile which was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.\nOperating income excluding SBC was $9.5 billion, up 19% versus last year, for an operating margin of 37%.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7.9 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%.\nAccrued capex for the quarter was $2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.\nTurning to Other Bets, I'll cover results for the full year 2016 because it's most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon as discussed previously. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.\nFor the full year 2016, Other Bets revenue was $809 million, up 82% versus 2015, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $2.9 billion for the full year 2016, a slight decline from 2015.\nIncluding the impact of SBC, the operating loss was $3.6 billion for the full year, an increase of 4% over 2015.\nOther Bets accrued capex was $1.4 billion for the full year 2016, up 63% over 2015.\nBefore I move to my conclusion, I'll quickly cover some specific changes to our past practices. First, we are making changes to our non-GAAP reporting. SBC has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results.\n\n Non-cash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.\nSecond, we are shifting the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle for employees to the first quarter of every year. The next full-year equity refresh will occur in the first quarter of 2018. Because the last full employee equity refresh occurred in the third quarter of 2016, we are providing employees with a one-time half-grant in the first quarter of 2017.\nOverall, total SBC for 2017 will be roughly the same as it would have been had we maintained a Q3 refresh cycle. However, given the shift in refresh timing, there will not be the historical seasonal increase in SBC in Q3 and Q4. We do not plan any changes to our senior executive equity refresh, which occurs every two years, with the next one planned for 2018.\nThird, to hedge our non-U.S. dollar earnings, we are moving from using options only to using primarily forwards. We believe they will be a more effective way to hedge earnings. We intend to continue to use options selectively.\nWe continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth provides the best insight into underlying trends by isolating the impact of currency movements on revenue. We will continue to provide constant currency results for consolidated revenues as well as for revenues by geography. This will give you a view into the effects of currency movements on our revenue.\nTurning now to our full-year 2016 performance and outlook.16 was simply a great year for us. Our extraordinarily talented employees worked very hard and successfully for our users around the globe. That commitment is reflected in the company's exceptional financial results.\nFor the full year 2016, consolidated revenue grew 20% and excluding the impact of currency movements grew 24%. GAAP operating income was up 23%.\nThis performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile Search, YouTube and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.\nAlongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our Other Revenue line grew 41% on a full-year basis, reflecting the growth in our Play, Hardware and Cloud businesses.\nWe see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses as well as in the continued\n\n development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our Cloud and Hardware businesses as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.\nWe're also investing significantly in the machine learning capabilities and next generation computing infrastructure that will propel Google's growth over the longer term.\nFor our Other Bets, we continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution paths. A couple of our recent announcements demonstrate our approach here.\nFirst, in December, Waymo graduated into a stand-alone business within Other Bets. We did this because Waymo achieved agreed thresholds on the path to commercialization in its technical and business model. Waymo continues to excel at safety, has begun putting its new Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the road, and is continuing to drive down hardware costs.\nNest delivered an outstanding performance this holiday season with sales of key products more than doubling over the two weeks including Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nAnd, just this morning, Verily announced that Temasek has agreed to invest $800 million for a minority stake in the company. Temasek\u2019s extensive experience with life sciences and healthcare companies and deep understanding of Asian markets make it a valuable long-term partner for Verily.\nThe internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see. We remain committed to managing for long-term revenue and EPS growth, for dollars rather than margin targets while exercising careful stewardship over the amount and pace of investment.\nI will now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Ruth. 2016 was a great year for Google and 2017 is shaping up to be even more exciting.\nThis quarter was about the business firing on all cylinders and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investment.\nToday I'm going to talk about three things. First, the key trend powering Google today, machine learning, and how it's improving our products and creating lots of opportunities. In particular, how it's underpinning our core mission of providing access to information for everyone, especially via the Google Assistant which is off to a great start.\n\n Second, I want to talk about three of our biggest bets -- YouTube, Cloud and Hardware -- where we are making great progress.\nAnd third, I'll discuss the great trends we are seeing across our platforms. Our vibrant computing platforms -- Android, Chrome and Daydream -- strong momentum in Google Play as well as our thriving advertising platform.\nFirst, machine learning and access to information. As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal, ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning.16 was the year that this became central to who we are as a company and the products that we built. We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like Search, Maps, Messaging and Google Play.\nYou\u2019ve heard lots of these examples. Easier email replies in Inbox. Better YouTube recommendations. The incredible cameras on our Pixel phones. And smarter bidding for advertisers in AdWords.\nA centerpiece of our machine learning efforts is the Google Assistant which allows users to have a natural conversation with Google to help them get things done across their experience. It's off to a great start. You can easily ask it to navigate home, tell you about your schedule for the day or even play trivia.\nWe reached a milestone last month with our announcement of the Assistant developer platform called Actions on Google. It gives developers like Uber, SongPop and Headspace the opportunity to build Conversation Actions for Google Home, and we'll expand it even further this year.\nThe Assistant is baked into our smart messaging app, Allo, which we expanded this quarter in languages like Hindi, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese.\nThis quarter, using Neural Machine Translation, we improved our translation ability more in one single leap then all our improvements over the last ten years combined. We'll be rolling Neural Machine Translation out across the more than hundred languages available in Google Translate in 2017 and also for all of our cloud customers through the Google Cloud Translation API.\nAnd Google Photos, which as you know has machine learning at its heart, continues to grow in popularity. Last quarter, we launched PhotoScan which helps you digitize all of those old printed photos that are probably stored in a shoebox in your closet, to keep them safe, organized and shareable.\nIn February, we are hosting a summit where our machine learning team and other experts will\n\n discuss the future of the TensorFlow open source initiative and share some of their latest demos.\nNow I want to spend some time talking about three big bets: YouTube, Cloud and Hardware.\nFirst YouTube, which remains the premier destination for online video globally and has seen tremendous growth. At the heart of YouTube's success is its booming community of creators. Every single day over a thousand creators reached a milestone of having 1,000 channel subscribers. We are focused on two main areas of investment. First, creating the best video experience that's fast, personalized, searchable and that just works. We have rolled out many new features to the platform, like 360 degree videos, mobile live streams and support for videos in virtual reality.\nAnd regions with limited connectivity we introduced YouTube Go which has transparency and control of data usage.\nSecond, we are focused on delivering content that gives fans exactly what they want through offerings like YouTube Music, YouTube Kids and YouTube Red. We have 27 Originals pairing some of the most popular YouTube creators with the biggest directors and producers in Hollywood.\nOne of our new originals called \"This is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous,\u201d about the courageous journey of a transgender YouTube star officially premiered at Sundance just a few days ago. The popularity of this original content has been successful in driving new subscribers and retaining existing ones -- and we'll do more in 2017.\nSecond, our Cloud business is on a terrific upswing. In 2016 we made huge strides building out our product offerings across all areas of Google Cloud Platform, or GCP. We routinely hear from customers that we have now moved well beyond table stakes, and we have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development and the ability to create connected business platforms, leveraging our recent acquisition of Apigee.\nOur product advancements across all of GCP in addition to our increased focus on how we work with enterprise customers have enabled us to accelerate growth with new Fortune 2000 customers while also inspiring our current customers to substantially expand their use of GCP.\nWe've also enjoyed strong growth with G Suite, our cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications. G Suite achieved a significant new-customer milestone last quarter. More than three million paying businesses are now using G Suite to collaborate smartly and securely in the cloud. Our increased success with enterprise customers relates to the unparalleled security and data protection we can provide by offering an entirely cloud-based solution that enables an extremely strong level of protection.\n\n For both GCP and G Suite, expanding our partner ecosystem continues to be a big focus and last quarter the team announced new alliances including Intel, Improbable, Slack, Pivotal and Red Hat. Our customers and partners are appreciating Google Cloud's dramatically accelerated pace of product rollout as well as our responsiveness to both their needs and aspirations. We look forward to showcasing customers, partners and all of Google Cloud at our next annual Next user conference in March.\nThird, Hardware. We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone which feature the Google Assistant built in. We're thrilled with the reception as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season.\nIn particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning.\nWe are committed to this for the long-term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully.\nWe'll also continue working closely with our ecosystem partners to create the best experiences for users.\nSo those are three of our biggest bets. We're also continuing to push the platforms that are powering our business and our partners' businesses.\nFirst, our computing platforms. And second, our advertising platforms.\nBuilding powerful open platforms has always been core to Google, and our platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream are creating more innovation, more choice for users and more opportunities for partners. This was on full display at the CES show. There we saw partners like NVIDIA and AirTV introduce new media players based on Android TV and Casio and New Balance shared their latest Android Wear smartwatches. We also worked closely with Samsung on a new generation of Chromebooks called the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus which are getting great buzz. And in VR, we recently worked with partners like Huawei and ASUS and others to introduce even more new Daydream-ready devices.\nCES is just a start, and there's a lot more coming from our great partners across these platforms in 2017, and we'll continue working hand-in-hand with them to provide the best experiences for our users.\nWe're also investing in ways to help developers succeed using our platforms. Last week, we announced that we are acquiring the Fabric mobile app development platform. This will work\n\n alongside our Firebase platform to help developers build better apps and grow their businesses. Since we launched Firebase at I/O, developers have created over one million Firebase projects. That's incredible momentum.\nGoogle Play helps bring our platforms to life on mobile and beyond, and it's experiencing great momentum. As a piece of trivia, do you know what 2016's top movie was on Google Play? I'll provide the answer in a second.\nPlay had a great quarter with continued growth in our top markets, as well as in emerging markets where user spend grew by more than 70% year-over-year in countries like India, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. As the content hub across our growing platforms, the Play team is working hard to help users get the most out of their devices through apps, games and premium content.\nIn Q4, the Play Store launched on Daydream, Android apps became available on Chromebooks, and we announced that the Play Store will soon be coming to Android Wear. The platform is also benefiting significantly from machine learning. We recently introduced a new Google Play Music experience that makes music streaming smarter and easier to use with better recommendations and playlists.\nAnd the answer to my trivia question, the top movie in 2016, was Deadpool.\nLastly, I\u2019ll quickly touch on the highlights across our growing advertising businesses. I'm so pleased with the terrific partnerships we\u2019ve continued to grow this year. We work incredibly closely and deeply with agencies, marketers and publishers worldwide. These relationships owe a lot to the hard work of our fantastic business teams around the world. Our mobile properties, like Search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play are where people turn when they're actively engaged. They are the prime time in the mobile era.\nWe had another successful holiday season where we saw two clear trends. First, this was the year that mobile shopping went truly mainstream, with shoppers using phones as they go to the store to locate nearby retailers, find promotions and comparison shop.\nWe recently introduced Promoted Places in Google Maps, helping advertisers stand out with branded location icons, showing promotions and live updates of popular times right when someone's looking for it.\nGap, Inc., is one example of a company that understands the importance of connecting with consumers on mobile devices. In December, they increased their U.S. mobile search ad spend with us, and as a result, they saw about four times the mobile traffic to their U.S. e-commerce sites compared to December of last year.\nSecond, we saw this season that measurement really matters, and advertisers want reliable\n\n ways of understanding where their sales and traffic are coming from and how their campaigns are working.\nWe saw increased use of our popular Store Visits technology over the holiday shopping season, helping businesses understand how online ads bring customers into their physical stores. In less than two years, Store Visits has helped advertisers measure over 3 billion store visits globally.\nNow turning to our thriving video ads business led by YouTube.\nMarketers are seeing terrific success here. Air France used YouTube's TrueView video ads in order to reach valuable business travelers and new customers around the world. By showing engaging videos, highlighting the unique experiences of Air France, they saw more than hundred million views throughout the campaign.\nTurner Sports partnered with YouTube and DoubleClick for NBA Opening Night to try a new way to reach fans for the start of the season. We helped them deliver real-time video ads with behind-the-scenes pre-game footage uploaded immediately into a YouTube TrueView ad campaign. Thanks to the campaign, they were able to reach 19 million more people across the Web with 17% lift in ad recall.\nSpeaking of DoubleClick, many news publishers who are using our Accelerated Mobile Pages are now plugging into our Ad Exchange to drive revenue. We are thrilled that most publishers are getting higher click-through rates and effective CPMs with their AMP pages.\nBefore I end, I want to highlight one area that I'm really proud of where Google is truly leading the way. As you know our data centers from Oklahoma to Chile to Finland enable our services to be blazing fast, and they are what makes it possible for Google Photos to offer unlimited storage. But to do all this they use lots of energy.\nIn 2012, we set a long-term goal to reach 100% renewable energy for our operations. In 2015, we procured enough renewable energy to cover 44% of our total. And in 2016, we increased it to more than 50%.\nI'm really proud that we'll reach 100% renewable energy for global operations in 2017. This is great for the environment, and with renewable energy costs declining, it's a huge win for our business results too.\nWith that, I want to thank the Googlers around the world who helped make this another exciting quarter.\nOver to you, Ruth.\n\n Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star and then the number one key on your touchtone telephone.\nIf your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key.\nAgain, to ask a question, please press star one.\nAnd our first question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you.\nI had a question for Sundar. I was wondering, I wanted to focus on the Cloud business. When we speak with CIOs about GCP they highlight in many cases the need for Google to improve upon its enterprise sales strategy. I'm just wondering if you could share with us the changes you've been making in that organization and the goals that you have for the Cloud business for 2017.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Heather.\nYou know, as I said in my opening remarks, I do think, you know, we are seeing tremendous momentum with our partnerships team and how we're approaching. We have a lot of new alliances which I talked about. So now we have teams dedicated to partnering with GSIs, and we have a team focused on technology partnerships, too.\nOn the GSI front, we announced a new alliance with Accenture last September to create industry solutions for a number of industries, including retail.\nSo for me, I think overall, you know, everywhere I look at, we are establishing a world-class enterprise team. Partnerships has been a big focus, and I have seen progress there.\nYou know, I think, you know, as I said in my remarks, overall, 2017 I expect to have a lot of momentum because we have moved well beyond the table stakes. Now we are really, you know, competing on areas which we think we have differentiation. I talked about data analytics and machine learning, security and so on.\nSo, you know, I think we are well positioned. The momentum when we look at the numbers internally, and as well as the traction we see in competitive situations, you know, I definitely think we're going to have a great year. And hopefully in the Next conference coming up, Diane and\n\n team will share a lot more details.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you.\nAnd our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first for Sundar. Now that you have this breadth of device ecosystem out there into the marketplace, wanted to know if we could get a little bit more color about what your learnings are about the adoption of the device ecosystem, how you're thinking about the go-to market strategy over the medium- to long-term, and how we might see sort of an evolution across operating systems.\nAnd then if I can, maybe one for Ruth. You called out a one-time charge in -- or one-time impact on the number in the quarter. I want to know if we can get a little more granularity about what went into that one-time expense so we could just sort of factor that in the financials. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, Eric, I'm assuming when you said the device ecosystem, you're talking about how our platforms are working at scale.\nYou know, the thing which I get excited about is, you know, computing is increasingly moving, rather than just one device, which is a dedicated computing device, to being there for users in their context. And you'll see computing increasingly embedded in many things. And we have a comprehensive strategy. You know, we do want people -- you know, we invest in it for the long run. We are improving our computing experiences with machine learning.\nWe expect to be there for users across -- across a device ecosystem, and we're also building things like Google Play to work across all of this so that users can have one coherent experience.\nI think, you know, we see great momentum both across our partner ecosystem as well as pushing the cutting edge of the experience which is what we strive to do with our own Hardware devices. And so I think the end-to-end strategy is working well for us.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of you noted the one-time item, there are really two that I'm actually going to call out. One was in cost of revenues, I noted that equipment costs were elevated by some -- some one-time charges, and so there was some pressure there. And then the other item that I noted was with respect to our tax rate. I noted that there was a slightly elevated tax rate this quarter. It's always affected by the geographic mix of results, but we did have a discrete item that affected the U.S. tax rate, just to make that clear.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC.\n\n Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thanks. Two questions, please.\nAgain, Ruth, on that $320 million one-time charge, is there any more detail you can provide on that? It seems like a relatively sizable amount.\nAnd then, Sundar, if you could talk a little bit about voice search, particularly in the home and in the car and the importance of getting devices out in the marketplace. And the challenge I'll throw to you is it looks to me like Google devices are being outsold ten to one or something like that in a lot of homes. And, you know, it's immaterial now but I could see in five years that there's a new voice search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home, that could be a real challenge for the company. Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So on the first one, trying to be helpful in giving you dimension and impact on cost of sales, but really not much more to add there. I think the other point is, as you're thinking about the Hardware business, it was gross margin positive. There were just some other variables in there.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And, Mark, on voice search, we are really excited about it. You know, I think it's a very natural way for users to interact. We think it will be one mode. Users will have many different ways by which they interact with computing.\nAnd for voice, you know, as you pointed out, we expect voice to work across many different contexts. So we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and, you know, trying to drive that ecosystem that way. And we want Google to be there for users when they need it.\nAnd even with -- even with Google Home, we just launched it in Q4. We had a very strong quarter there. And, you know, we are going to invest a lot in it over 2017.\nIt's very early days. You know, when I look at what it would take to voice search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play, and I think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And, you know, this is the core area where we have invested in for the very long-term, and so I feel very comfortable about how this will play out in the future.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thanks for taking the question.\n\n Ruth, you commented on YouTube and addressed some of the non-advertising revenue streams. I was just hoping you could elaborate there a little bit what the goals would be there for your users.\nAnd then just to follow-up on Mark's question on voice search, I understand, Sundar, it's early, but how do you think about the challenges and opportunities from a monetization perspective in voice? Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So on the first question in terms of YouTube, Sundar elaborated on my opening comments, we're really pleased with the ongoing strength we have there. As we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, it's largely driven by video, primarily TrueView with a strong contribution from DoubleClick Bid Manager. And we are continuing to invest significantly in the business given the importance of supporting the ecosystem of content creators through partner payments, marketing, YouTube Originals, YouTube Spaces. We're broadening the platform. We're investing in the requisite infrastructure given machines and bandwidth required. And Sundar elaborated on some of the upside we see there on the non-ad side. And really the point I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's comments is we've got the non-ads momentum here on the YouTube side and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with Cloud, which we're excited about, and the hardware and investing behind those. So those continue to build out the revenue streams as we're looking in the near to medium- to long-term.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And, Doug, just like Mark's question on voice search, I would encourage you to think about it from a user\u2019s standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on.\nSo when we think about something like the Google Assistant, we think about this as an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts So they may ask a question on voice. Later, when they pick up their phone, they want continuity. So we think of this as an end-to-end thing.\nAnd all of this means users engage more with us, more with computing and look for more information. And I think the trends we see are positive.\nSo, you know, we think about it from a long-term perspective. And so I see more opportunity than challenge when I think about voice search.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells\nFargo securities. Your line is now open.\nPeter Stabler (Wells Fargo): Thanks very much. Another one on YouTube, if I could. Would it be possible to get any sort of metrics around YouTube Red and how the subscription business\n\n has been progressing, realizing you're not going to be providing that every quarter but that you do occasionally give us some sort of benchmarks in the market. Thanks so much.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Well, at this point, we've launched in five countries. We're pleased with the early success. And, you know, it's still early days. It takes a while to build a subscription business here. And I'll pass it to Sundar for additional commentary.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Look, I mean, I think -- I would think about it as we're investing a lot in developing this premium experience. We have YouTube Red, YouTube Music and we do offer it across Google Play Music as well.\nYou will see us invest more. More countries, more original content. And we'll bring together the experiences we have over the course of this year so it's even more compelling for users.\nBut, you know, we are seeing tractions -- tractions with the rate of sign-ups. We're not disclosing specific numbers, but I'm excited at the progress there.\nPeter Stabler (Wells Fargo): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two.\nThe first one, just to go back to YouTube. I appreciate the color around the content. I would be curious to hear about how you think philosophically about partnering with more premium content players to maybe drive even higher engagement and even better YouTube experience.\nAnd then the second one, if you kind of step back in your mobile search business and the verticals, the innovation you've had at retail and in travel with shopping and Hotel Finder, I guess I'd be curious to hear about where you see the biggest potential for more improvements in certain verticals for an even more relevant and higher search result experience over the next years. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On your first question, you know, look, I mean, we think of YouTube again as an ecosystem. We are trying to connect creators with users, form a community. And so, you know, we work hard to bring more premium content. You know, we already work with TV networks and their individual shows, whether it's the Late Night show like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, afternoon shows like Ellen, sports programming like NBA and NFL. For example, sports is one of the most popular verticals. We have hundreds of sports partnerships in place. And so we'll continue to invest that way and drive -- drive the premium content there.\n\n On the second one, you know, if -- you know, we do look at the Internet experience, look at what are the kinds of tasks which users are trying to get done. Mobile raises the bar. You know, we want to provide those deeper experiences for users. And so, you know, I generally think local is a big area. We have strong assets there with Maps. And so we think about how we can improve the local experience a lot more for users.\nSo, for example, within local areas like dining, we work closely with our partners to make that better.\nSo we get it -- we get it at a pretty granular level and we try to hit all the areas. And so I think you'll see progress in all these areas over the next few years.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of\nNomura. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Nomura Instinet): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on YouTube, I'd love to hear about pricing and then also about ad load. So is there anything you can highlight on ad format? And specifically we notice that recently you're enabling marketers to target YouTube ads based on Search. And so I just want to hear about that strategy. And maybe relatedly, the recently announced non-skippable YouTube ad format, you know. Would love to kind of hear about that. Thanks for taking my question.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Look, overall I would say there's been a -- been very pleased with how the team has been driving, you know, innovation in ad formats and the ad experiences. I think video advertising is in its very early days.\nYou know, we see whenever we -- so we are in an innovation phase, and the advertiser response to all of these new formats has been really positive. So, for example, Bumper Ads, our six-second video format that we launched, is already being used by thousands of accounts, including major brands like Universal Pictures and Netflix.\nOn your question around how we think about the experience across screens, you know, it's really important to understand users, you know, consume YouTube across screens, and so they experience a consistent experience. And similarly from an advertising standpoint, we want that to be thoughtful for users, more relevant across screens as well.\nAnd so that's the context in which we do this. We give users control over the ads experience. But I do think as part of these changes, advertisers, you know, can get more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices so they can better understand the impact of their marketing campaigns.\n\n So I think it's early days, but I think it's the right direction, and I think we will see good traction from it.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, speaking on the YouTube questions, there was a report that YouTube and CBS had agreed on an agreement to distribute CBS on YouTube. Can you talk a bit if that is actually happened? And if so, what do you see the opportunity to partner with networks and how will that evolve over time?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Look, you know, I can't comment on any specific discussions, but, you know, I said a little bit earlier, you know, we are constantly working with partners across these areas. You know, we work very closely with TV networks on their individual shows. It's a big part of the YouTube experience. So you'll see us work hard to make these partnerships deeper and bring more content to our users. So maybe I'll leave it at that.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Okay. And then for Ruth, you mentioned programmatic drove the network numbers, revenue growth this quarter. If you look at fourth quarter this year and last year, there seems to be an acceleration in Q4 and then it comes back. I wonder what's happening seasonally to that revenue line that drives fourth quarter up so much?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Well, as we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, there are obviously a number of businesses within the network line and a number of things went right this quarter. I wouldn't extrapolate from it. As you noted, there can be some seasonality, and Q1 is typically lower than the fourth quarter. I think the main point is that the programmatic business continues to be a strong contributor with significant growth, reflecting the ongoing advertiser adoption just given the overall efficiency of programmatic and improved targeting and the benefit of inventory growth.\nAnd so the story is pretty much unchanged. We continue to see the growth in programmatic offset by declines in the more traditional businesses. And, you know, when you\u2019re looking at the quarter over quarter, you're continuing to see things like the impact of policy changes and timing of product launches. But I just think that there were a number of things that went well this quarter. Q3 was a bit lighter, so that then flattered the quarter-over-quarter comparison, but I wouldn't extrapolate from this.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Okay. Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\n Lloyd Walmsley (Deutsche Bank): Thanks. I'm wondering, Sundar, if you can just give us a sense on the Pixel phone hardware opportunity to kind of build direct mobile distribution and capture hardware margin, and how you think about that versus the potential disruption, you know, having your own handset at a bigger scale could cause in the Android ecosystem. You know, do you think this is something that could get meaningful market share without disrupting the ecosystem?\nAnd then, you know, a second follow-up related to this would be on the Pixel phones, you know, with Google Assistant having been built uniquely into the core of the experience, is there anything you're learning as the usage of that increases? Is it driving a step-function increase in engagement with the hardware/software integration? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Look, I mean, we are in early days. I think it's really important when you work on a platform, you know, you have to drive it forward. So we\u2019ve always done by putting out, you know, the state of the art. And I think it especially gets important in the vision we have for computing where users are going to use it across many different contexts. And so to do that end-to-end experience, it spans devices. So I think it's important for us to work at the intersection of hardware, software and services. And so that's how we think about it.\nAnd I think, you know, we invest a lot more in our ecosystem. And I mentioned earlier, I'm incredibly excited about the line-up that we have for this year from our partners.\nSo we do both and we're very thoughtful about it. I think -- I think the scale at which we're doing it shows it's working. And, you know, I'm confident we'll be able to strike that balance well.\nIn terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how -- how Search works, I think, you know, definitely, you know, it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users. You know, our thesis is that you know -- as we make it easier for users to have Google at their fingertips across what they are doing, and including many modes, whether they're typing or asking Google a question, you know, we find that it overall benefits. And so it will be a long-term trend, but I think our early results show that our intuition is right there. And so we'll continue approaching it that way.\nLloyd Walmsley (Deutsche Bank): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit\nSuisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Okay. Thank you. So, Sundar, you called out Google Play growth, and emerging markets in your prepared remarks, so I thought from a revenue-size standpoint, it would be one of the big bets you would highlight. So I'm wondering how you view your own Instant Apps as well as products from other operators to let consumers try apps either\n\n in a messenger product or in an HTML5 environment. Do these innovations present an opportunity or a challenge for you and the Play franchise?\nAnd, secondarily, it seems that the recurring theme in your prepared remarks is how AI is making the consumer products better. Is there anything you can share in terms of how it may be making monetization better? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: So on Google Play for me, what makes it -- makes it work well is, you know, just with the vision of computing we have been talking about, about how, you know, it works across context. You know, you need an ecosystem -- you need an apps and services ecosystem to work cohesively across all of this. And that's what I like about how we're approaching Google Play. And you saw us this quarter see Google Play work beyond Android phones. They're coming to Chromebooks. They work in Daydream. They work in Android Wear. And so it's an end-to-end thing which works well.\nAnd that's the -- that's the most important thing, so that as a user you know, whether you're engaging with a game or a TV show, that you can reliably get it across your computing experiences.\nAnd we'll adapt, and I think we will drive innovations in Play to go where what's right for users and developers. And so, you know, be it instant apps or driving better HTML5 experiences, we invest in all that and I think we'll move it all forward.\nOn your second question, you know, about how machine learning and AI is improving our monetization, it definitely -- I mean, just like we -- we had many, many launches last year, you know, which involved machine learning being incorporated across Google, including our monetization products. Our monetization teams at Google have always been at the cutting edge of, you know, what I would call of machine learning techniques from early days on. So they are -- they are doing it.\nIt is early days, but I think we already have, you know, really new insights. And so we'll bake it in, you know, over the course of the year.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore.\nYour line is now open.\nKen Sena (Evercore): Hi. Maybe just another question on YouTube. You know, can you expand on the decision this quarter to remove third-party cookie and pixel activity? It looks as though you're favoring something much more identity based. And maybe you could just think through or explain a bit about the impetus there and maybe the trade-offs for marketers. That would be great. Thank you very much.\n\n Sundar Pichai, CEO Google: I spoke about it a bit earlier, but I think it's important that we evolve all of this from a user-centric standpoint. And, you know, users have an identity. They have preferences. And so, for example, think about it from a user standpoint, if they don't like one particular ad, or they don't want to see an ad from a particular advertiser, they want it to work across their experience, across their cross-device experience.\nSo we think about it that way, and so we're working towards a long-term experience that's right for users and which I think will make sense for advertisers reaching users, too. So I think we're evolving it jointly and thoughtfully, giving users control. And I think that's the right way to approach it over time.\nKen Sena (Evercore): Thank you very much.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from Justin Post of Merrill\nLynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Thank you. I'd like to ask you first a question about ad coverage and click rates. Maybe just your thoughts on potential to increase ad coverage now that you have a fourth link. Is there still room to help ad clicks with coverage increases? And just as you think out to this year, how do you feel about the innovation pipeline in ads? Do you think there's a lot more you can still do in Search?\nAnd then two housekeeping for you, Ruth. Maybe you could just let us know what kind of equipment was written off so we can think about how recurring that might be, and any comment on the buy-back activity in the quarter. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On the -- on the -- you know, on our monetization efforts, our teams always have been very thoughtful about planning, not just for the short-term but planning for the long-term.\nYou know, we don't start the year thinking our plan is to increase ad coverage or something like that, right. We are -- we have many experiments in the pipeline. We see how user behavior is evolving. And in conjunction with that, we evolve our ad experience. For example, as people use mobile, scroll more, et cetera, the user behavior changes and we adapt to that in a very, very disciplined way.\nSo, you know, last year you saw us maybe increase coverage in a certain way. For example, in desktop we removed ads on the right-hand side. So we take a very holistic approach to these things.\nFor me, I do think we have a lot of headroom ahead. I still look at where most of, you know, transactions happen and how that secular transformation is underway. And so I think we see\n\n we have a lot more headroom left. And Ruth --\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Yeah. In terms of your second question, really not much more to add on the first part. In terms of the buyback, we weren't able to commence it in the fourth quarter due to trading restrictions, but we do look forward to getting back into the market.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2017 call.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.", "20171": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see \u200b the Q1 2017 Earnings Call web\u200b cast.\nAlphabet Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 27, 2017\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Alphabet first quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time the participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations:\u200b Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you were waiting, you were listening to the infectious song Diggy by Spencer Ludwig. Spencer is a new exciting artist on Warner Brothers Records who is touring Europe this month. You have heard his trumpet stylings when he performed with Capital Cities on Safe and Sound. Be sure to check out his official Diggy video on his YouTube channel.\nNow I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our form 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our investor relations website, located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues of $24.8 billion in the first quarter demonstrate our broad-based strength globally with revenues up 22% year on year. In constant currency, our consolidated revenues grew 24% versus 1Q16.\nGrowth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in Other Revenues from Play, Hardware and Cloud.\nOur outline for today's call is: first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet.\n \n Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I will focus on year-over-year changes in our results. As a reminder, I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation, for operating income, net income and earnings per share. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook.\nSundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.\nLet me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.\nTotal revenues were $24.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $304 million, or $87 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year.\nTurning to Alphabet revenues by geography, as you can see in our press release, we have enhanced the geographic split to give you more insight into our businesses around the world. We are now reporting our revenues in four regions: the U.S.; EMEA, namely Europe, Middle East and Africa; APAC or Asia-Pacific; and Other Americas, which encompasses Canada and Latin America. To help you with the transition to our new geographic reporting, we're also sharing the U.K. revenues for this quarter.\nThese groupings align more closely with how we manage our businesses and also with the major currencies that affect our results. The results by region highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenues were up 25% year-over-year to $11.8 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 19%. U.K. reported revenues continue to reflect the ongoing weakness of the British pound with revenues up 5% year-over-year to $2 billion on a reported basis, yet up 16% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year, and up 26% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strength of the Australian Dollar and Yen. Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America were up 34% versus last year to $1.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 29% year-over-year with fixed FX growth reflecting strength in the Brazilian real.\nOn a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year on year.\nOther cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; and content-acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube; as well as Hardware related costs, reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line.\n\n Operating expenses were $8.4 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year. Year on year comparisons in part reflect the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle, with a half-year grant in Q1 which enables us to move to a single, annual compensation cycle. As discussed last quarter, this affects the timing of stock-based compensation but does not affect the overall size of the SBC expense for the year. The year-on-year increase is therefore more sizeable in Q1 and Q2 compared to previous years with less of a year-on-year impact in both Q3 and Q4. More specifically, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion, up 34% year-over-year.\nHeadcount at the end of the quarter was 73,992, up 1,939 people from last quarter. The growth in consolidated headcount was somewhat muted by an internal reallocation of people from Fiber to Google. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount growth was in Cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business.\nOperating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 27%. Other income and expense was $251 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 20% for the first quarter. Net income was $5.4 billion and earnings per diluted share were $7.73.\nTurning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.5 billion with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $92.4 billion, of which approximately $55.7 billion, or 60%, is held overseas.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $24.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX.\nIn terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $17.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% year over year. The biggest contributor to growth again this quarter was mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously also benefiting from our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality. YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising.\nNetwork revenues were $4 billion, up 9% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob. Results benefited from a slower rate of decline in the traditional network business than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy efforts.\nOther revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 49%. Last quarter we talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, Hardware and Cloud.\n\n Specifically, Play benefited from both broad-based app strength but also from all the work we have done in areas such as direct carrier billing which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite apps and games on Google Play.\nHardware continues to have strong growth and remains an important area for us with our family of products extending geographically. Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth with Google Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet.\nFinally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 22% year over year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas -- namely mobile search and programmatic -- carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year over year.\nOperating income including the impact of SBC was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%.\nAccrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.\nTurning to Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $244 million, primarily generated by Nest, Verily, and Fiber.\nOperating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $855 million for the first quarter.\nOther Bets Accrued CapEx was $170 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q16.\nLet me conclude.\nFirst, we've benefited from our teams' innovations that continuously enhance our advertising business as evidenced by the ongoing growth of Sites revenues. On a dollar basis, the increase in Sites revenues reflects the healthy growth in mobile search. As we discussed in prior calls, even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing investment in the mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is adding meaningfully to\n\n profit dollars.\nSecond, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud, Hardware and YouTube subscription offerings.\nCloud is one of our most important strategic priorities given the scale of opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector and the fact that the requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity. Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for us -- and you've seen the early indicators again this quarter.\nFinally, in Other Bets, we're determining the size and pace of investment appropriate to each Bet given their stage of development and achievements against milestones.\nWe expect to increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along a path to commercialization. For example, as I hope you saw earlier this week, Waymo announced it has commenced a trial of its self-driving cars in the Phoenix area. Waymo also announced it is expanding its fleet of minivans to support this trial. These actions reflect the tremendous accomplishment of our team over many years, leading with safety, and now beginning to bring the experience to consumers.\nI will now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200b Thanks, Ruth.\nIt's been a terrific start to the year. This quarter was notable for the fantastic momentum across our products -- advances for the Google Assistant, the launch of YouTube TV, and lots of new features launched at our Google Cloud Next event.\nIn the next few weeks, there's much more to come. We'll host our annual developer conference, Google I/O, our advertising event Google Marketing Next and our YouTube upfront, Brandcast.\nI hope you'll join us.\nToday I'll discuss three things. First, how our continued investments in machine learning are fueling innovation across Google -- and particularly, how it's helping drive our core mission of providing access to information for everyone. Second, progress in three of our biggest bets -- YouTube, Cloud and Hardware. And third, our platforms -- such as Android and our advertising platform -- which power businesses and computing experiences around the world.\nNow turning first to machine learning and access to information. I'm really happy with how we are transitioning to an AI-first company. The Google Assistant is one of our first steps toward that future. This quarter we brought the Assistant to your wrist with Android Wear 2.0, announced that it will soon come to Android TV, and began rolling it out to hundreds of millions\n\n of people with Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow. We also continue to announce the new integration partners for the Google Assistant so you can now ask it to do things like \u201cdim the living room lights.\u201d Stay tuned for more to come. Advances in machine learning are helping us to make many Google products better. One example from this quarter is the launch of parking predictions in Google Maps.\nBeyond that, we continue to set the pace in machine learning and AI research. We introduced a new technique for training deep neural networks on mobile devices called Federated Learning. This technique enables people to run a shared machine learning model while keeping the underlying data stored locally on mobile phones. DeepMind is bringing AlphaGo to China in May, pairing AI with the world's best players at the Future of Go Summit. And it's very exciting to see the incredible things that developers and researchers are building on the TensorFlow platform -- there are more than 6,000 GitHub projects and counting!\nSearch remains at the heart of our mission to make information available to everyone, and we are laser focused on making search even better. In March, we introduced tappable shortcuts in Google Search to help you easily access topics you care about, like sports, entertainment and weather. And earlier this week, to improve our results further, we introduced algorithmic ranking improvements, as well as easier ways for people to provide direct feedback in Autocomplete and Featured Snippets.\nLast week we made big improvements to one of our longest standing and most-loved products -- Google Earth. It's really beautiful and easy to use -- now you can experience breath-taking locations in virtual reality like the top of Table Mountain in South Africa.\nMoving on to three of our biggest bets, YouTube, Cloud and Hardware.\nFirst, YouTube where we continue to see extraordinary growth in opportunities. People around the world are watching more content on YouTube than ever before. In 2016, we passed a big milestone that continues to grow: every day, users watch over a billion hours on YouTube. YouTube continues to be the most popular destination for online video globally, and we're focused on building awesome experiences. This quarter we announced YouTube TV, which offers live TV from major broadcast and cable networks, a cloud-based DVR without storage limits, and streaming on all of your devices. We\u2019ve launched in five cities so far and the positive feedback from customers has been really incredible. Our destination for family and kids content -- called YouTube Kids -- also recently celebrated its second birthday. There have been more than 30 billion video views in the app to date.\nNext our growing Cloud business.\nOur Google Cloud Next conference in March was a great opportunity to highlight core areas of differentiation for GCP, like new security products and the recognition that we had the highest Cloud availability in 2016, according to Cloud Harmony. It was attended by five times as many\n\n people as last year.\nWe also demonstrated new machine learning services and announced our acquisition of Kaggle, the largest community of data scientists focused on machine learning and AI. We introduced dozens of new products, including Spanner, a database optimized for distributed computing that can reliably update data across multiple data centers, and our G Suite team introduced a major expansion of our collaboration platform with Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat.\nTo give you a taste of the kinds of large enterprise customers and partners we are now working with across GCP, we were joined on stage by major companies like HSBC, Home Depot, Schlumberger and SAP, as well as large new G Suite customers including Colgate Palmolive.\nWe continue to see tremendous momentum in education, where our products are leading the industry -- thanks to their simplicity, security and low cost. Chromebooks are now used by more than 20 million teachers and students, and more than 70 million people actively use G Suite for education.\nOver the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane and her team are having with customers. Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast growing business.\nOn to our next big bet, hardware.\nLast year, we debuted a beautiful new family of hardware devices, including the Pixel, Google Home and Google WiFi -- bringing together the best of Google across hardware and software. We are finding that people who buy products like Pixel and Google Home are not only incredibly happy with their purchase, but also very likely to recommend it to others. Sales continues to be strong, and we are actively working to bring these great devices to more people around the world. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that Google Home and Google Wi-Fi are now available in the U.K. Speaking of Google Home, last week we made it possible for up to six people to connect their accounts to one Google Home, and thanks to a leading voice-recognition technology, it can recognize who is speaking to it. It's really a game-changer.\nAnd finally, we are continuing to invest in our computing and advertising platforms.\nOur platforms have had great success over the years -- creating incredible user experiences, as well as real opportunities and economic success for partners, creators, and developers around the globe. To illustrate: in the past three years, in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa alone, we paid out more than $15 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners. That's across AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. And it doesn't even include device sales by many hardware partners who build on Android.\n\n There's tremendous momentum in the Android ecosystem as evidenced by the great reception of the beautiful Samsung Galaxy S8. We will have much more to say at I/O next month. In March, we introduced the first developer preview of Android O, featuring improvements for battery life, notifications, and picture-in-picture display. The Android platform is also seeing great growth in emerging markets. In 2016, nearly 300 million new users adopted Android devices from countries like India and Brazil. We also announced a public launch of Android Wear 2.0 with two new flagship watches from LG. And thanks to partnerships with major brands like TAG and Fossil, there will be more than 20 different Android Wear watches available this year -- doubling the number from last year.\nOur virtual reality platform Daydream -- which debuted almost a year ago --continues to gain traction with more devices and more great content like VR video. More than 50% of time in Daydream is video consumption, and YouTube VR is Daydream's #1 app by time spent.\nLastly, I'll talk about the highlights and trends we are seeing across our growing advertising business where there are still enormous opportunities.\nAs you can see from our results, we continue to experience remarkable growth worldwide. Not only are existing advertisers choosing to spend more as they see the value of our ads, but many more businesses around the world are just getting started on our ad platforms -- from India to Brazil and many more.\nOur momentum continues to be driven by the shift to mobile. Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the \u201cprime time\u201d for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested. We've increased our investment in machine learning in our advertising business with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the performance of an ad, and adjust advertisers' bids in real time to maximize their results. Two areas where we\u2019re seeing particular strength are retailers and app developers.\nMobile has transformed the shopping experience. In the past year, local shopping queries have increased by 45% and the number of retailers that provide us with their local inventory feeds has doubled. Our investments in innovative ad formats, improved targeting and better measurement are really helping retailers who see us as an ally in their corner. Brands like Williams-Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile sales year-over-year with Google's mobile shopping ads playing a big part.\nSecondly, developers use us to help their apps stand out from the crowd. Thanks to our app install advertising products, developers have already driven more than 5 billion app downloads. Our flagship product here, Universal App Campaigns, allows developers to easily promote their apps across Google Search, Play, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. It incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results for advertisers. We recently announced new innovations at the Game Developers Conference, including an interactive\n\n playable ad format in Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your game right in the app. It's really effective in driving installs from engaged users.\nNow on to our growing video advertising business.\nBrands love the reach and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new Bumper Ads, which are snackable six-second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency. We recently did research on more than 120 Bumper Ad campaigns, and the data showed that they drove a significant lift in brand awareness and ad recall. Under Armour used both Bumper Ads and TrueView together to promote a new product launch recently, resulting in double the lift in product interest among people who saw both ads, compared to those who only saw the TrueView ad.\nWe work incredibly hard to get -- to create the best environment for brands on YouTube. The cornerstone of our offering is Google Preferred, which allow brands to advertise against the top 5% of our content.\nWe\u2019ve also announced new safeguards for advertisers through a combination of updated ad policies and enforcement, new default settings around where ads can appear, improved controls for advertisers, and third-party brand safety reporting. Brands and agencies understand how hard we work to create the safest possible environment. We do this while also being very careful to ensure YouTube's innovative creators can earn money to support their unique and popular content. We have been actively engaged in conversations with clients about the new tools and controls we are providing, and we\u2019re having very productive discussions ahead of Brandcast next week.\nFinally, programmatic advertising.\nAs marketers continue to shift to its programmatic ad buying, our DoubleClick platform makes it easy for them to effectively reach the right audiences. We've been focusing on making more inventory available to more advertisers, especially premium inventory. For instance, we recently expanded our Programmatic Guaranteed reservation product to advertisers globally. And we made traditional TV inventory available to buy in DoubleClick Bid Manager.\nSo that's a run-through of some highlights for the quarter. Thanks to every Googler for making Google such an exciting and inspiring place to work every day. Over the last few days we've had Take Your Child to Work day at Google which is one of my favorite events of the year. We've had thousands of excited screaming kids running around the Googleplex, which is how I feel some days, too. What motivates us at Google is building the technologies that will be central to all of their computing experiences, to give them opportunities to learn, to be heard, and to succeed.\n\n And with that, I will hand it back over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star followed by the number 1 key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. Again, that's star 1 to ask a question. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): \u200b Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, just you talked about Cloud as a huge strategic priority. Can you just talk more about the go-to-market strategy for GCP and how you plan on building up the reseller channel there going forward?\nAnd then secondly, Sundar, on Waymo, I was curious on some of your thoughts, I know it's early, but on the timing for Waymo to become commercially viable. And what are the key guideposts and requirements along the way? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b On the Cloud stuff, talking about go-to-market, you know, as Ruth said in Q1 our largest growth in headcount and CapEx was in Cloud. So we are thrilled with the progress we have made there since Diane arrived, building out world-class sales, marketing and engineering teams.\nThe heavy lifting I would say is around how we meet enterprises in the market. We have reorganized so we have one face to the customer. So it's not just sales reps. We've been thoughtful about how we have built out the entire go-to-market organization. So we've created two new areas that customers can now take advantage of. One is the Office of the CTO, which helps customers solve difficult technical problems. And the second is our Advanced Solutions Lab where customers can get help from machine-learning experts.\nAnd on top of that, now we have a phenomenal support team that helps keep customers' applications up and running.\nSo, you know, I think what we have done, our approach is one Google. When a customer signs up for Google Cloud, they get more than GCP and G Suite. They have access to the Ads and Analytics team, YouTube teams, and resources within our organization. So I think it's coming along quite well.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b And then on your question on Waymo, we view Waymo as a great example of a graduate from X that's addressing a sizable problem and builds off of tremendous technology here. We started with safety. We remain a leader in safety, and we continue to view that as the foundation for success. And at this point we're exploring many\n\n options: enabling ride sharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics and deliveries. And we also see opportunities to work with cities to address public transportation.\nSo the announcements this -- that we made this week -- are a continuation of the progress the team has made. We do have a strong relationship with Fiat Chrysler, increased our car order, given the opportunity. They have been our primary partner today, but to note we're in active discussions with others around the globe. And then I think importantly, the trial in the Phoenix area is something that's been in the works for some time and we do look forward to that trial. So it's still in the early days, and we're excited about the upside from Waymo.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan):\u200b Great. Thank you both.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs):\u200b Great. Thank you. I also wanted to ask a question about Cloud as a follow-up. I was just wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us what's the feedback been since Next from your -- from your Cloud customers? And could you share with us how qualitatively, something so we can gauge just kind of whether this is starting to see -- whether this business is starting to see an inflection in growth or not. Is there anything you could give us qualitatively about how the pipeline is building in this area? And I guess just what I'm interested in is also the types of conversations you're having with customers now versus maybe six years ago. Or, I'm sorry, six months ago. Sorry about that. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Time flies fast. You know, I mean, Next was -- you know, having done Google I/O many, many times, I was surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this year. We had five many times as people.\nI think, you know, I think everyone really appreciated seeing large customers, very sophisticated customers, like HSBC, eBay, Colgate Palmolive, et cetera, discussing use of Google Cloud, GCP. You know, along with Diane, I did follow-up lunches with a set of people, and, you know, so the feedback has been very positive. You know, people sense our commitment to the area. They understand the pace at which we are investing. They see that we are committed to machine learning and AI at a deep level. They appreciate how we are open sourcing things. You know, Fei-Fei's talk was extraordinarily well received. They are noticing the acquisitions we are making. Kaggle and AppBridge are a couple of acquisitions which happened around that time.\nSo all that, all those details I think clearly made an impact. I just spoke about the go-to-market progress. And, you know, I think that's -- that's beginning to get traction as well.\nIn general, you know, I think there is a very strong recognition that we have pivoted to a -- being a deep enterprise company. And, you know, the conversations are very strategic. We are\n\n engaging at the highest levels within companies. And so, you know, overall, I can see qualitatively the momentum there.\nYou know, when we are in the middle of deals, you know, we find we are very competitive, and there are areas where customers perceive us as best-in-class already. So it's been exciting to see.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.\nYour line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS):\u200b Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you mentioned Google Assistant in your remarks. I wanted to know what have you seen in terms of consumer adoption of Google Assistant, whether at the Pixel level or the Google Home level. What does it give you in terms of the sense of how people want to interact with the Assistant, what it might do in terms of putting artificial intelligence capabilities down to the consumer level and improve consumer experiences over the next couple of years. Thanks so much for the color.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Good question, Eric. I mean, Pixel is a good example because I think, you know, it's the place where we do the leading work here. And, you know, how we presented Google Assistant and the Pixel, you know, well received, both qualitatively in terms of consumer feedback we get. Quantitatively in terms of how we see people using Voice, how we see people interacting with overall Google Assistant and Search better. So you know, we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader level.\nIt's always surprising to us, you know, all this. Even with Search, every single day we see so many new types of queries. When you bring the Assistant in the mix, you start getting even more different types of queries. And queries are more casual, more conversational, you know. And so over time I think it starts breaking down the barriers to computing people have. And that's what makes it very, very exciting.\nYou know, artificial intelligence will help us push all that further. Just to give an example, we will make text-to-speech much, much better over time. You know, yesterday we announced our neural machine translation is launching in nine new languages. So all that starts accruing to the Assistant and I think -- I think will, overall, improve the consumer experience pretty dramatically. We'll talk about all this a lot more at Google I/O, so stay tuned.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): \u200b Great. Thanks. Two questions, please. One on YouTube and one on 12\n\n Google Maps. Sundar or Ruth, there was some press about some of the pushback or some of the controversy around content and advertising and monetization of that. Were those -- are those technical problems that can be solved over time or is it just a magnitude of the volume of content and trying to keep, you know, bad content off the site, however that's defined, and keep it from being monetized? Is that -- Is that just -- Is that an ongoing technology challenge or did you already find the solution? And did you see any material impact to advertisers' budget interest with YouTube?\nAnd then if you could also comment briefly on Google Maps. This is one of those massive properties that you've owned that's highly used by almost everybody, and I think the monetization to date has been really de minimis. Is there anything that's changed for you in terms of your thought about the ability to monetize Google Maps over time? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b You know, on advertising and monetization in YouTube, you know -- you know, we talked a bit about it. We have -- we have taken it pretty seriously, and we're taking significant steps. And, you know, obviously as part of doing that, we've brought new technical solutions into place. Machine learning is a great example of it. You know, it helps us enforce -- as we improve our policies, it helps us enforce it better. And we are in early days. So as machine learning gets better, I think -- I think we\u2019ll be able to do all of this even better and create that virtual cycle.\nOverall, I'm pretty confident at the rate at which we have made progress. And we're going to continue investing a lot here. It is super important to us that this ecosystem works well. It matters for advertisers. It matters for content creators. And so we take that responsibility very seriously.\nI would say, you know, advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made. Our conversations with them are very very positive. And, you know, so I'm pretty optimistic about how we'll continue to make progress here.\nOn Google Maps, your question is -- you know, it's a good question. I get surprised at -- you know, for a property which we had launched many, many years ago, even now there are -- you know, it's showing strong growth, especially in emerging markets. Maps is an integral part of your mobile phone. And as we get more -- as users get more interested in the real world around them, you know, with AR and so on, I think Maps will continue to play a bigger role.\nWe take a long-term view. It's already impacting monetization very significantly for us with local search. So today when you use Google, a lot of the information we are able to do is because of Google Maps. But I'm sure you've noticed changes within Google Maps over the past few months. You know, if you open Google Maps, you're traveling or you\u2019re about on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, places to eat, and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users, and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there over time as well.\n\n Mark Mahaney (RBC): \u200b Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells\nFargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nPeter Stabler (Wells Fargo): \u200bGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on Mark's question on the local opportunity. Assuming that you agree it's a large one, what kind of steps are you taking to educate the smaller businesses out there on the opportunities you have? You've mentioned increasing take-up of local inventory ads. We understand that. But more generally, a go-to-market strategy on how you reach the millions of SMBs out there in terms of educating them on the growing opportunities on a local basis. Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b It's a great question, and I think there's a lot of opportunity for us. Today we have much touch points. Obviously people -- you know, we reach out to SMBs, they want to get listed in Search and in Maps. AdWords Express has been a big part of how they want to advertise on our platforms. We obviously provide things like Google Apps to SMBs. So we have a lot of touch points, and internally we are beginning to do a much better job of reaching out and having a more thoughtful go-to-market approach.\nI think there's a lot more work there -- work there, but the rate at which we're seeing advertisers, small-medium businesses on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well. So indications are that it's already currently working at scale. We have millions and millions of SMBs on our platform and the number continues to grow very well, but you'll see us invest a lot more here in the years ahead.\nPeter Stabler (Wells Fargo): \u200b Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): \u200bThanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit more about the retail search category? Any high-level commentary on consumer search query trends in retail, either an area of strength or otherwise? And then you talked about the real-time local inventory integration. But, Sundar, I'd be curious if you can talk about any opportunities or areas of innovation in the retail search space that you see to really continue to improve users' retail search experience. Thanks for the color.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b You know, I think, obviously, when we -- when we see what users are looking for in mobile, you know, how shopping is evolving, it's an area we're continuously working on. You know, I've been happy to see the evolution in our shopping experiences.\n\n Retail overall, you know, also happens to be an amazing category for us from a Google Cloud standpoint. So in some ways we are developing deeper partnerships with retailers around the world. And so as we start doing that, and, you know, I think as we get a better understanding of their inventory and the data, how we can translate all of that into our core experience is a bit of the work ahead. And I think that's what excites us about the longer term.\nShort term, I think it's a space we continue to invest in. We are actually seeing strong trends in that category.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): \u200bGreat. Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): \u200b Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions on YouTube for Sundar. First, this morning on the earnings call, WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell noted that the company is being very responsive, I think were his words, to some of the recent concerns that we've talked about earlier in the Q&A. We've also seen some official policy changes, things like that. I'd be interested, Sundar, to hear a little bit more about some of the softer outreach that you may be doing, thinking of Philipp Schindler's team, maybe the agency relations team, and how your people are reaching out and connecting with their clients, especially as you go into Brandcast.\nAnd then the second follow-up on YouTube was I'd be interested to hear your updated thoughts on the role of the YouTube Spaces. I think Ruth's prepared comments on CapEx mentioned some investments in production equipment. I don't know if that is related to that or something related to Cloud, but it does seem that the Spaces remain an important part of YouTube and continue to grow and I'd love to hear an updated view on them. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b You know, on the first part, I mean, I think you kind of -- one of the things I've noticed is the depth of relationships we have with our advertisers, you know, was very evident to me as we went through -- through this over the past few weeks. You know, I would estimate I think Philipp Schindler's team has probably made literally thousands and thousands of calls, in-person conversations, and I think that deep relationship is what allowed us to respond thoughtfully. And I think the feedback from our partners were very positive and constructive, and I think we are evolving overall to a better place. And so I think, to me, that shows the long-term investments you make in these relationships, et cetera, you know, plays -- plays well at times like these.\nAnd you know, Brandcast is again an important touch point, and the excitement ahead of Brandcast, both internally and from our partners, you know, all has the right indications for us.\n\n On YouTube on Spaces, you know, I visited the YouTube Space. I took my family to the YouTube Space in New York and we had a lot of fun. Our creators love these Spaces. They are something we are thoughtfully building out. You know, they have a good return on investment for us, you know, but we are very thoughtful about it. And I don't think that's a major factor in any of the CapEx we talked about here.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Yeah, exactly. And the CapEx, when I talked about production equipment, we were talking about machines, and that was the primary driver here. We're investing more in machines, given both our growing requirements and the higher cost of the new generation of machines and accelerators, so that will be more expensive in the short term and we are continuing to build our inventory, but it does increase performance and we believe reduce total cost of ownership in the longer term. Just to clarify that on CapEx.\nDan Salmon (BMO): \u200bOkay. Great. Thank you both for the color.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.\nYour line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays):\u200b Great. I'm not sure if this is for Sundar or Ruth, but a question about regulatory. You guys recently reached an agreement in Russia around the Android bundling issue where you're going to provide options for other browsers and search engines and app stores when a new Android phone is activated. So I'm just wondering if this is the right way to think about these kinds of disputes in other areas of the world where you may be under some regulatory pressure around Android bundles or if that was kind of a one-off, isolated agreement. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b You know, I think without getting into specifics, I think when we deal with regulatory issues, I mean, the concerns vary differently depending on local laws and what the concerns are. I think in the case of Russia, I think there were some specific issues, and I'm glad we were able to work together with the regulatory agencies there, with our partners there to come to a good solution. I'm not sure that's the right template, but as much as -- we're very committed to making sure we work with all the right agencies in all the countries we operate in, and I'm confident we'll get to a good place.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): \u200b Great. Thank you. Sundar, ahead of this advertising conference I was thinking about Search innovation, and over the last four years you've had an acceleration with PLAs, a real acceleration with the third ad link, and I'm just wondering maybe if you can talk about what excites you or do you think there's still a lot to go on Search monetization or coverage?\n\n And then from Ruth, obviously so many areas you can invest in. You could cut price on Cloud. You could really, you know, ramp up engineers in the core or Cloud. Just a lot you can do. And just how does the management team think about balancing profitability versus driving market share and long-term growth? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b On -- you know, on Search, you know, I continue to get surprised by the kind of things users reach out to us for and how that keeps evolving and changing. So that -- you know, and with the Assistant now, too, just exposes a whole new surface area. And so I think there's a lot of innovation ahead.\nIn terms of monetization, you know, I think about it. It still looks like there is a lot of -- for example, if you just look at retail, 90% of retail is still offline. So there are many, many secular trends like that which we look at it and we see a huge opportunity to help connect users to the information they are looking for.\nSo structurally, I do think, you know, we still have lots of both innovation and growth ahead for the long term. And, you know, that's how we think about it. Maybe to Ruth on the second part.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Yeah, and really actually building on that to answer the second part of your question, when we look at the ongoing momentum you see here in Sites revenue, it really does go to innovation. No one change tends to drive results. It's really the combined benefit of all that we're doing across the franchise, continuing to invest in the business and the benefits that we see there.\nAnd that's the way we look at it, is we have tremendous opportunity continuing in mobile search and in YouTube across the business there. And as we're looking at these newer opportunities, all that we're doing in Cloud, in Hardware, YouTube subscription businesses, we analyze each one of those individually, working very closely with the leaders and the milestones that are established there. We do very much across the business have an operating principle that too many resources and too few can lead to suboptimal decisions and execution. And so what we're looking at over a multi-year period is the pace of innovation that's appropriate given the sizable opportunity.\nBut the key point, and I've said it on so many different calls, is that we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we're excited about the growth opportunities not just within Google but across Alphabet with all that we're doing in Other Bets.\nAnd so we're looking at these, again, individually, over a multi-year period, looking at milestones and appropriately calibrating the pace of investment that is logical. And at the same time, we continue to have a focus on enhancing efficiencies -- efficiencies where we can. But overall, as I keep saying, our main priority remains revenue and profit-dollar growth.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of\n\n Moffett Nathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (Moffett Nathanson):\u200b Thanks. I have two for Sundar. The first is, now that you've launched YouTube TV, I wonder if you can tell us about the advertising opportunity there. And what are you going to do, given all the assets, to maximize the inventory for marketers?\nAnd then, secondly, I wonder with that focus on brand safety you hear now from agencies and the bigger marketers, what's going to be the long term impact, do you think, to YouTube and programmatic from a more focused -- a more focused view on finding the right places to advertise?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b You know, on your first question about YouTube TV, we're just getting started. You know, I love -- I think the product is really intended for the YouTube generation. It's really great to see it take on how to consume TV, which is mobile first, for that generation. And I think -- I think -- I've been using the product and enjoying it. And I think that gives -- As we rethink that experience and make it work better and scale it up, I think it's -- your question is valid. The delivery of ads on TV has also not evolved at the same speed as the delivery of ads and media content on the Internet. So I think -- we think we have a significant opportunity to improve that experience, and especially for advertisers to be able to think across all these surfaces. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, but I think we have -- we are very focused on the consumer experience first.\nOn your second question around, you know, longer term impact, look, these types of issues are not new for us. Over the past many, many years, as we built services, scaled it up on the web, constantly things evolve. We adapt to it, be it from spam in email, or how we do Search ranking and all the efforts we put into it. You know, these are the classes of problems our engineers are really, really good at working. These are large-scale system problems. And especially with machine learning and AI, over time I think we can really put in the right -- right systems in place. And, you know, our teams work very thoughtfully with the external ecosystem, with our advertisers, agencies and partners. And I think that balance will help us get it right for the very long-term.\nMichael Nathanson (Moffett Nathanson):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of\nNomura. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Nomura Instinet): \u200b Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year. I totally understand that mobile search is contributing meaningfully to the profit dollars, but as we look at the Sites TAC as a percentage, is there a quarter or is there a point in time looking forward where that sort of elevated TAC growth rate will anniversary or fall back\n\n into line with Sites revenue growth as a growth rate? Is there anything you can do to proactively manage that TAC growth?\nAnd then for Sundar, on YouTube, as the competition out there for video content really intensifies, to what extent is YouTube providing more favorable economics to its content creators in order to ensure that YouTube remains the leading platform and, importantly in a lot of cases, an exclusive platform for your most popular channel? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b So on Sites TAC, as we\u2019ve often discussed, and as you said in your question, there are a number of factors that affect Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, and the primary driver has been the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. The other factors include the mix of paid versus organic as well as changes in partner mix or agreement terms. And when we look year-over-year, the primary driver of the increase is, very much to your question, the strength in mobile search. And we do expect Sites TAC to increase as a percentage of revenues. But again, our focus continues to be on growing profit dollars. And I think the main point is we're very pleased to have a very strong business in a rapidly growing area, and that's benefiting our profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b And on YouTube, when I look at it from a content creators standpoint, you know, I think there are a lot of factors which are working well. So, for example, when we recently invested in Original shows, you know, we find that, like, over half the time people spend watching Originals is on their mobile phones. We find that creators who are featured in Originals experience a significant boost in YouTube subscribers and watch time on their main channels as well, often from new fans.\nSo all of this shows us that the enthusiasm which is there for the platform, how creators can do unique things which are different from what they can do on other platforms. And I think that's what gives us the differentiation here. And in these areas, we're just getting started and so there's a lot more to come. And I think that will help us provide, you know, better economics to them, better engagement for them, and I think positions us well.\nAnthony DiClemente (Nomura Instinet): \u200b Thank you both.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nBen Schachter (Macquarie): \u200b Sundar, when you think about virtual reality and augmented reality, from your point of view, what are the key steps that are needed to see more mass market appeal and usage? And could you help quantify the amount of investment that you are willing to place in this area before you expect to see a payoff? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b So, you know, I think, you know, obviously you're seeing, you\n\n know, we are very happy with the progress we have seen with Daydream. Just like we built Android. We are good at building platforms and ecosystems, and I think we're taking the right first steps with VR there as well.\nWhen I broadly look at VR and AR, I think there are -- you know, I think all of us clearly understand the potential, and technically we are making the breakthroughs that are needed. And all of it needs to converge, you know, from a hardware, software, services standpoint to a stage where it has mass market appeal, and I think that is still some ways away.\nThe thing which gives me excitement is, you know, all these changes start happening with a set of early adopters and moves mainstream, and so we are engaging at that level with early adopters, and that's where Daydream is working well. We are learning how to write great content on top of VR. YouTube, Google Earth VR. These are Tilt Brush. These are all great examples. So we -- and underlying technology-wise, be it all the kinds of sensors and tracking you need to do, the machine learning and AI you need, things like voice recognition, everything is just a computing evolution. So everything we are investing today in machine learning and AI as well as what we are doing in our computing platforms transitions well. So, you know, I think we are already well positioned to play this. And so I think we'll thoughtfully approach it. And we'll approach it more holistically.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Robert W. Baird):\u200b Thank you. I guess just as a a follow-up to the question on voice interfaces and personal assistant, something that Larry also called out in his Founder's letter. It appears there are more tests around monetization, including transactions and integration with Shopping Express. I wonder if there's a view internally now as to how best to make that transition in a voice-first world towards monetization towards voice and less text and video centric. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b You know, we are very focused, actually, on the consumer experience now, and, you know, it's a good question, and we've always had these questions, you know, be it the early days of Search or when YouTube was first built out, you know, how do as these experiences created, like, you know, will YouTube ever make money. So I think if you go and create these experiences in a way that works at scale for users, the monetization will follow. And obviously the models will be different from what we have today, but I think we are squarely focused right now on delivering a world-class experience through Voice and through Assistant.\nColin Sebastian (Robert W. Baird):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.\n\n Ellen West, VP Investor Relations:\u200b Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2017 call. Thank you and good day.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.", "20172": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the \u200bQ2 2017 Earnings Call webcast\u200b.\nAlphabet Q2 2017 Earnings Call July 24, 2017\nCandice (Operator): \u200bGood day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Alphabet second quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star, then zero, on your touch-tone telephone. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: \u200bThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200b Thanks, Ellen. Our revenues of $26 billion in the second quarter demonstrate the ongoing momentum in our businesses, with broad-based strength globally. Revenues were up 21% year-on-year, and up 23% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefitted from the strong performance in Sites, which was led in particular, by tremendous results in mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube. Healthy growth in Network revenues was driven by our programmatic business. We also had substantial growth in Other Revenues from Cloud, Play and Hardware.\nOur outline for today\u2019s call is: first, I\u2019ll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which include the impact of stock-based compensation. The European Commission fine of $2.7 billion U.S. dollars is reflected in our GAAP results, with the fine displayed as a separate line item for clarity. In order to assist with comparing this quarter\u2019s results to prior periods, we are also providing\n\n operating income, net income and EPS results that exclude the impact of the fine. The fine is not reflected in our segment results. Second, I will review results for Google, and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.\nI will start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter: Total revenues were $26 billion, up 21% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $364 million, or $361 million after the benefits of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 23% year-over-year. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong in all regions. US revenues were up 23% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year reflecting weakness in the British pound and the Euro; revenues were up 21% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.7 billion, up 28% versus last year and up 27% in fixed FX terms. Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were $1.4 billion, up 31% versus last year in both reported and fixed FX terms.\nOn a consolidated basis, total costs of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, were $10.4 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content-acquisition costs \u2014 primarily for YouTube; and Hardware related costs.\nOperating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $11.5 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year.\nYear-on-year expense growth reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. As discussed previously, this affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017 but not the overall size of the expense for the year. In order to transition to the new timing, we made a one-time, half-year grant in Q1 of this year which is reflected in elevated year-on-year expense growth in Q2. As a result, stock-based compensation totalled $2 billion, up 33% year-over-year.\nHeadcount at the end of the quarter was 75,606, up 1,614 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.\nOperating income was $4.1 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating income was $6.9 billion, up 15% versus last year and the operating margin was 26%. Other income and expense was $245 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% for the second quarter. Net income was $3.5\n\n billion and earnings per diluted share were $5.01. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $6.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $8.90.\nTurning now to capex and operating cash flow. Cash capex for the quarter was $2.8 billion. Operating cash flow was $7.4 billion with free cash flow of $4.6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $94.7 billion, of which approximately $57.9 billion, or 61%, is held overseas.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results.\nStarting with the Google segment. Revenues were $25.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $18.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. The biggest contributors to growth again this quarter were mobile search and YouTube. Network revenues were $4.2 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strength of programmatic and AdMob.\nOther Revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 42% year-over-year. We have been talking about our bigger investment areas within Google, and you can see the momentum here, reflecting contributions from our newer revenue streams again this quarter, on top of the ongoing strength in Play. Specifically, Cloud continues to benefit from the ongoing investments in our go-to-market and product efforts. Hardware continues to grow at a healthy pace year-on-year, with the extension of our product line geographically, particularly Google Home and Wifi. The dollar impact to growth was more muted than in prior quarters, reflecting seasonality.\nFinally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.\nTotal Traffic Acquisition Costs were $5.1 billion, or 22% of Total Advertising Revenues, and up 28% year-over-year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites Revenue as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network Revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas \u2014 namely mobile search and programmatic \u2014 carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totalled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. Operating income including the impact of SBC was $7.8 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. Accrued Capex for the quarter was $2.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.\nA couple of Google reminders for the third quarter. Headcount additions tend to be seasonally high in Q3, because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind\n\n that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season, particularly as we promote our Made by Google line of hardware products.\nLet me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the second quarter, Other Bets revenues were $248 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $772 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued capex was $151 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q16.\nWe\u2019re pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion such as our recent introduction of the indoor security camera, Nest Cam IQ, as well as geographic expansion, both of which support its position as the leading brand in the connected home. In life sciences, in addition to our progress at Verily, Calico has focused its efforts on the basic mechanisms of aging and three aging-related diseases representing the leading causes of death. Calico has established more than 20 active collaborations with other life sciences companies and academic institutions. With Loon, we recently demonstrated the technology in Peru by successfully delivering basic Internet connectivity to tens of thousands of people affected by the tragic floods there. We worked in partnership with the Peruvian government and Telefonica. And our progress with Waymo continues nicely, as is reflected in the rider program in Phoenix and our recently announced partnerships with Lyft and Avis.\nLet me wrap-up. Almost two years after the creation of Alphabet, we see the benefits of our focus within Google and Other Bets and are pleased with the opportunities we have for sustained revenue and earnings growth.\nWe are obviously very happy with the ongoing strength in ads revenue, particularly in Search. Our compelling secular trends continue to drive user adoption and engagement with mobile devices. Our engineering and machine learning acumen enables us to build better experiences for users and advertisers.\nWe continue to see increasing contributions from our growing non-ads revenue businesses. Play continues to be a strong contributor. In addition, we have been making big bets within Google focused on Cloud, Hardware and subscription businesses in YouTube, in order to better serve customers while also building additional and differentiated revenue streams. These businesses are consistent with, and complementary to, our core capabilities and leverage our infrastructure, distribution and engineering. We believe we have a compelling runway here.\nLonger-term, we see great opportunity in the businesses we are building in Other Bets. These businesses reflect the incredible engineering talent across Alphabet \u2014 most notably in machine learning.\n\n Our revenue growth and Alphabet structure give us both the opportunity and confidence to invest in our businesses for the long-term. We are doing that, while being very deliberate about the focus, scale and pace of investments and remain committed to being conscientious in our use of all resources. We\u2019re increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential, scaling back in others and sharpening our organizational effectiveness to make the most of the resources available.\nThank you and let me now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b \u200b Thanks, Ruth. We had a phenomenal quarter. Google continues to lead the shift to AI-driven computing. We\u2019re working to make this incredible technology available to everyone around the world. It\u2019s our focus on infusing our products and platforms with the power of machine learning and AI that\u2019s driving our success.\nToday I\u2019ll spend time talking about the areas where we\u2019re confidently investing for the future. First, the incredible momentum we\u2019re seeing in some of our core products, powered by machine learning. Next, an update on three of our most promising bets \u2014 YouTube, Cloud and our Hardware businesses. And I\u2019ll conclude with the strong performance of our computing and advertising platforms.\nTo start, our core products and the AI powering them.\nGoogle has always been about using deep computer science and insights to solve some of the world\u2019s most complex problems. People are no longer only using a keyboard, mouse, and multi-touch, but are also using emerging inputs like voice and camera to ask questions and get things done in the real world. We are seeing this in the way people interact with the Google Assistant, which is already now available on more than 100 million devices since launching last year, and there\u2019s more to come since we released an Assistant SDK that will enable a wide range of new hardware devices which will include the Google Assistant. We now have more than 70 home automation partners on the Assistant on Google Home and phones, including Honeywell, Logitech and LG, so you can do everyday things around the house using your voice.\nAt Google I/O, we announced Google Lens, available later this year. Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you\u2019re looking at and help you take action based on that information. So, for example, if you saw a poster for your favorite band, you would be able to take a picture and get relevant information, and buy tickets to their next concert. In Search, a great feature we launched this quarter in the U.S. is Job Search, to make looking for a job easier \u2014 for everyone, no matter what line of work you\u2019re in. Many of these products that make people\u2019s lives easier are being powered by machine learning. One focus area for us this quarter has been enabling our machine learning algorithms to learn \u2014 and improve our products much faster. One such research initiative, AutoML, enables us to pursue approaches to automate the design of machine learning models.\n\n Our ability to rapidly deploy the best machine learning in all of our products enabled us this quarter to launch all sorts of new smart features \u2014 to help moderate comments, suggest smart replies in Gmail, and improve translations. We rolled out new machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos, which now has more than 500 million monthly users who back up 1.2 billion photos and videos every day.\nI was also pleased that DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo team was in Beijing [correction: Wuzhen, China] for the Future of Go Summit, where AlphaGo played against the #1 world player, Ke Jie. Since playing AlphaGo, Ke Jie has been on a 20 game winning streak \u2014 he\u2019s said playing AlphaGo has fundamentally changed his understanding of the game. It\u2019s remarkable to see AI have such a profound effect on one of the world\u2019s oldest, most strategic games. It can have the same impact in so many fields \u2014 from medicine to science to energy usage and more.\nNow, let\u2019s move to some of our biggest bets.\nFirst, YouTube. YouTube now has 1.5 billion monthly viewers, and people watch, on average, 60 minutes a day on their phones and tablets. That\u2019s incredible, and it helps thousands of passionate video creators make money. The fastest growing screen for YouTube is in the living room. YouTube watchtime on TV screens has nearly doubled year-on-year. This quarter we unveiled six new ad-supported YouTube Originals from celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart, and YouTube creators like Rhett and Link. Advertiser feedback on these new shows has been extremely positive. Last week, our live TV service, YouTube TV, added ten new metro areas across America, tripling the markets where it\u2019s available, in just 4 months.\nAnd to our next big bet with great momentum, Google Cloud. Google Cloud Platform, GCP, continues to experience impressive growth across products, sectors and geographies \u2014 and increasingly with large enterprise customers in regulated sectors. To be more specific about our momentum with big customers: in Q2, the number of new deals we closed worth more than half a million dollars is three times what it was last year. Responding to the growth in existing and new customers around the world, we continue to invest in data centers to provide them the fastest, most reliable service. We opened new Google Cloud regions in Northern Virginia, Singapore, Sydney and London. We also continue to build out our partnerships. In Q2, we announced an expansion of our partnership with SAP, and a new partnership with Nutanix to integrate their products with GCP, so customers can run workloads in hybrid environments \u2014 on-prem and in the cloud \u2014 using containers and Kubernetes.\nNow let\u2019s talk about our Hardware business. Sales of our new family of hardware continue to be encouraging and we\u2019re making good progress bringing these devices to more people. Google Home is now available in four countries: the U.S., Canada, Australia and the UK. And we\u2019ve announced it\u2019s coming to France and Germany in early August. The Pixel phone continues to be really popular, and Google Wifi just launched in Canada, Germany and France to glowing reviews. Every day I hear of people who love this product and how it has made Wi-Fi work much better in their homes.\n\n Shifting gears, our computing and advertising platforms are driving great results for our partners.\nThere are now more than 2 billion monthly active Android devices around the world. It\u2019s really humbling so many people choose Android. We\u2019re seeing a number of hardware makers launching devices to positive reviews, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6. At Google I/O this quarter, we gave developers early access to Android O, which will focus on vitals like battery life and performance. And Google Play continues to be a vital distribution platform for developers. An incredible 82 billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last year alone. That\u2019s 11 apps for every person on Earth. We continue to work on the next generation of computing platforms \u2014 virtual and augmented reality. By the end of this year, there will be 11 Daydream-ready devices on the market, from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and ASUS.\nTurning to our advertising platforms.\nHere too, machine learning is critical to helping advertisers and app developers analyze data in real time, to reach consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness. At Google Marketing Next this quarter, we launched Google Attribution, a comprehensive measurement tool that allows marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns across devices and channels, all in one place with no additional cost.\nWe also launched new ad formats and bidding features in Universal App Campaigns to help developers grow their user base across Google Play, Search, YouTube, Gmail and the Display Network. At Google I/O in 2016, we announced we had driven 2 billion app installs. Today, that number is more than 5 billion. That\u2019s amazing growth. With 90% of transactions still happening offline, we want to help consumers find what they\u2019re looking for in brick-and-mortar stores. Our store visits technology is instrumental in understanding customer behavior that starts online and ends in store. Today, our Store Visits measurement is the largest program of its kind, and we\u2019ve now measured over 5 billion store visits in 17 countries. This quarter we also brought local ads and Store Visits measurement to video.\nSpeaking of video, we\u2019re seeing continued success with bumper ads, our 6 second ad format. Both brands and viewers love the format as it\u2019s the ideal length to capture attention. L\u2019Oreal, Hasbro, Xbox, Clinique and Neutrogena have all seen great success with bumpers. And Google Preferred continues to grow. We now have hundreds of brands buying Google Preferred in the U.S., nearly triple the number since it launched 3 years ago. We\u2019re not just helping large brands, we\u2019re also helping millions of small businesses get online and grow.\nEvery month, Google helps drive 100 billion visits to business websites, and creates more than 3 billion direct connections between businesses and their customers. These interactions drive huge economic opportunities and growth for small businesses. Last month, to increase these opportunities, we launched an easy way for millions of small businesses to create a free, simple,\n\n mobile-optimized website. Small businesses can do it on a mobile phone in under 10 minutes, using the listing information already available on Google Search and Maps.\nAnd finally, helping publishers grow their revenues remains a huge focus for us. We\u2019re using the power of automation and machine learning to improve our auction algorithms for publishers. The 50 improvements we\u2019ve made since 2016 are generating 15% more revenue for publishers using DoubleClick Ad Exchange. Those are the highlights from the second quarter.\nThis week will be another highlight for me. I\u2019m going to Africa for a \u201cGoogle for Nigeria\u201d event to announce new products for Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing first hand how technology and Google\u2019s products can make a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\nI want to express a very sincere thank you to every Googler who worked tirelessly this quarter to bring all of our technology and products to the world. And to everyone listening, thank you and I hope you\u2019re enjoying starting the week off with us. And now, back to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bThank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if you would like to ask a question at this time, you may press star, followed by the number 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. Once again, that's star 1 to ask a question at this time. And our first question comes from John Blackledge \u2014 I'm sorry. Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS):\u200b Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a big-picture question directed to Sundar. As you think about the Google Assistant and what it can do medium- to long-term, maybe talk a little bit about how the Assistant as a product could narrow the gap between consumption and utility inside your products versus monetization over time with a specific focus,I'd love to hear about local in particular. Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b\u200b It's a good question. You know, when I think about, you know, we have \u2014 we are very focused over the long term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get things done in the real world, and so obviously when you think about it from that standpoint, local becomes important. You know, over time \u2014 you know, just like when the transition happened from desktop to mobile, you know, people's bar for what they expect increased. They wanted more answers. They wanted more immediate gratification, right? And that's a continuum, and I think \u2014 I think you'll see the trends. And so over time, we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver against those experiences, and I think local, and our particular strength over time, both in terms of the expertise we have built in local as well as our investment in Maps, is hopefully paying off.\n\n Candice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): \u200bGreat. Thanks for taking the question. First, one for Ruth. I was just hoping you could help us understand at least qualitatively how core margins for the advertising business are trending within the Google segment. And then Sundar, just on the Cloud business, I know you talked about four new regions being built out. Can you just talk about your strategy in building out that Cloud infrastructure, how we should think about it in terms of building out extra capacity or whether it's more in line with near-term demand? Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Thanks. So starting with your margin question, look, as we've \u2014 as we've often said, we're focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins. We have strong positions in healthy growing areas and are adding really exciting additional growth areas, and that's what we mean when we discuss driving long-term revenue and earnings growth. You know, to get a little more specific, the gross margin this quarter obviously reflects our product mix shift, and although the cost of sales is higher as a percentage of revenues, these costs are associated with high-growth product areas that enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then, on the opex side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors. First, I think really to your question on an over-time point, you can see the impact of the timing shift in the equity refresh which we discussed previously. Now, as a reminder, that does abate in the back half of the year but you can see it here in the \u2014 in the second quarter. And then what you're also seeing in opex growth is the investments in areas that we've spelled out. So for example, in R&D, you can see the impact of the headcount increases in our priority areas, particularly Cloud and machine learning. And marketing spend, similarly reflects the strategic priority areas we've delineated, particularly, Hardware and YouTube subscription. But as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential, we're scaling it back in others, we're focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our resources, and all of that really underpins the goal to sustain both revenue and earnings growth over the longer term.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): \u200bThanks. That's helpful.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman): \u200bThank you very much. I was just wondering, Sundar, you mentioned some of the strength you're seeing in GCP, and I was just wondering if you could share with us, when you do win, is there any commonality around the type of workloads that people are choosing you for? And can you share with us any updates on the go-to-market and kind of how you feel about where you've come over the last year, but even more importantly, what do you need to do to get it where you need it to be over the next 12 months? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b \u200bThanks, Heather. I'll also take Doug's question on the\n\n infrastructure, too, and do it together, since they're related to Cloud. Overall, you know, when we think about our infrastructure, obviously we are serving Cloud as well as our internal products which are seeing tremendous growth as well. In terms of serving Cloud customers, you know, we are \u2014 you know, we are world-class in availability and being reliable, and we \u2014 you know, and those are, you know, things we \u2014 you know, we want to stay best in class. So we're clearly planning for that and \u2014 you know, and \u2014 and planning ahead for infrastructure and we have been consistently doing that.\nHeather, in terms of your question about workloads and stuff, you know, we are actually seeing, you know, quite a diverse set of use cases across sectors and industries and geographies, and so, you know \u2014 you know, I would say, you know, the breadth of what we have seen has really surprised me. In terms of go-to-market, you know, I shared an update on last \u2014 on it last quarter. Not sure there's much more interesting to add. We are continuing to do it well. We are scaling up. And, you know, all the teams and the structure Diane has put in place is beginning to work well. And we are continuing to hire and scale all of this up as quickly as we can.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. Heather Bellini (Goldman):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC):\u200b I'm going to try two questions, please. First, one on TAC. You know, Ruth, the factors that cause \u2014 have been causing TAC to rise, seem, you know, relatively structural. The outsized growth of mobile and the rise of programmatic. So there's no particular reason to think that we should see anything other than gradual increase in TAC as a percentage of both O&O and Network revenue going forward. So are there any \u2014 any reasons why that wouldn't be the case in the, you know, next year or two?\nAnd then Sundar, I thought one of the more interesting innovations or \u2014 that was \u2014 that kind of came out of Google I/O was visual search, and could you just talk about, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 maybe a little bit the roadmap for that, or the extent to which \u2014 how long it will take us to actually see that broadly in the market and, you know, what you \u2014 what you think the appetite or how do you think that will change the way people search for products in the future, the ability to, you know, also search, you know, visually through your phone? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b So on the first question, there are obviously a number of factors that affect Sites TAC. We've talked about them over time. You know, the primary driver again this quarter, as you note in your question, was the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. But the increase in Sites TAC year-over-year, I think what I would stress is it really provides another lens on just how strong our mobile business is. You know, there are other factors that affect the TAC rate, including the\n\n mix of paid versus organic traffic, as well as changes in partner mix and agreement terms, but I think, you know, the \u2014 the main point of your question here is we do continue to expect Sites TAC to increase but our focus remains on growing profit dollars and I'd go back to my comment \u2014 we're just really pleased with the strength of our mobile business, which is benefiting profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases. And, you know, programmatic, you know, kind of a very similar answer, which is, we're pleased to have a strong position in a growing area.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b\u200b And, you know, on questions around visual search, you know, when we think about Google Lens, we think about it as a set of capabilities which we'll roll out across many different products but we'll mainly starting getting it in the hands of our users in Q4. You know, I think early days, we \u2014 we want to \u2014 we want to make sure it works well for use cases, where it can, and bet on the long-term trends in computer vision as we make progress there. I also think, you know, there are cases where pulling out a phone and looking at it is a bit cumbersome and so over time as form factors emerge, you know, where it's more natural for you to look at and input that into computing, it will get used more. Overall, you know, for humans, the way they see, you know, visual input, it's a very high bandwidth way of communicating, and so it's important that we bring that in computing. So long run, I'm very bullish on it, but, you know, we're going to roll this out slowly and thoughtfully.\nMark Mahaney (RBC):\u200b Thank you, Sundar. Thank you, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells\nFargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nPeter Stabler (Wells Fargo): \u200bThanks much for the question. One for Sundar. At Marketing Next, your team unveiled new ways that Google is leveraging consumer intent signals across your billion-user-plus platforms. It seems that some of the walls between product data silos are being lowered a bit, and one of the obvious gains that Sridhar highlighted was search personalization. Wondering if you could speak broadly to the opportunity of looking at data from a targeting perspective more holistically across platforms. Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b\u200b You know, I think it's important we've always felt, you know, as marketers when they \u2014 when they spend and \u2014 you know, and try to reach users, the more we can give them visibility about how their spend is working and they can attribute, you know, across all the stages of the funnel, I think \u2014 I think that will really help make everything work well. So, you know, we've always taken that long-term view and \u2014 you know, and everything we do, you know, be it Store Visits, which we did a while ago, or more recently at Google Marketing Next we talked about Google Attribution as well, you know, so all that starts adding up and I think pushes in this right long-term direction. And there's more work to be done, but I think as users use everything across multiple products and devices in a thoughtful way, I think making all of this work well, we see it as a, you know, opportunity ahead of us.\nPeter Stabler (Wells Fargo):\u200b Thanks, Sundar.\n\n Candice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley):\u200b Thanks for taking my question today. I have two. The first one, you've talked about micro moments throughout the course of the year, micro moments on mobile. I was wondering could you give us a couple examples of micro moments or Search verticals where you've really seen an increase in your monetization over the last year? And Sundar, as you look out across all the Search verticals, what are the two biggest one or two use cases you still see to improve the overall relevancy of Search results and potential monetization?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b \u200bYou know, on the first one, you know, I'd probably be \u2014 rather than be very specific, you know, anytime people are looking to buy, find, go, do things \u2014 you know, you could be looking for a local pizza, you could be buying \u2014 you know, we see queries like \"jeans near me\" and people are looking for jeans next to them, so these are all very, very specific things, and in all of \u2014 all of these cases, we have found we've been able to impact the experience for both users and advertisers. So I think that applies generally broadly. In terms of all the verticals, I think there are a lot of opportunities. Local has been, you know, an area of strength for us. We've seen a lot of traction and, you know, I continue to think as a vertical, you know, given the assets we've built up over the years, we can \u2014 we can continue to invest more and do better for our users.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley):\u200b Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.\nYour line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays):\u200b Great. I had two questions for Sundar. First is, you mentioned the 15% yield improvement on publisher yield through DoubleClick from machine learning. Is there a comparable stat inside of Google owned and operated Search or YouTube? After implementing machine learning you saw yield improvement of \u2018X\u2019? I'd be curious to hear that. And then the second question is: as we look out into the future and you guys mentioned 2 billion Android actives at I/O, and you just mentioned 11 apps per user in your prepared remarks. If Google is forced to unbundle their own apps from Android in the future, what's the strategy to ensure that Maps and YouTube and Search, you know, get distribution and Android doesn't kind of go the way of China and other markets? I'd be curious to hear that. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b \u200bLet me take the first one first. On machine learning, you know, we definitely \u2014 you know, machine learning, we've been using it on Search. You know, RankBrain has become one of the important signals, in addition to the many other signals in Search, and so definitely has had an impact. Same on YouTube across the board. You know, I don't have any specific metrics to give, but we definitely are seeing impact and \u2014 and we think\n\n we are in the early days of the impact we can see. In terms of Android, you know, we are obviously thoughtfully, you know, building Android out and scaling it out and, you know, we offer our apps as part of it. You know \u2014 you know, OEMs get to distribute other apps as well. We think, you know, it's a very open market, open ecosystem, works well for everyone involved. And, you know, I \u2014 I expect that to continue. And \u2014 you know, and a lot of our products which are successful on Android happen to be successful outside of Android as well, including on the Web. These are products generally used by billions of users, and by now, you know, we have worked hard to earn that trust and scale, and so, you know, I'm confident we can continue scaling those up.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO Capital):\u200b Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I think the last update we heard publicly on promoted places on Maps was in December when you announced that you'd be beginning some limited tests. I don't think there's been any public comment from the company since then, and quite frankly, we haven't heard a whole lot anecdotally about it either, so I was just hoping for a quick update on that product. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b\u200b You know, overall, I mean, it's an area where we are still like really focused on, you know, improving the consumer experience. I think \u2014 you know \u2014 we are evolving Maps to be a lot more beyond just driving directions, and users are responding to it, and \u2014 and I think, you know, we are in the process of making all that work better. And also, we've also focused in terms of what we see as local opportunity within Search as well. But we'll continue testing and evolving. I think, you know, we want to make sure we get the consumer experience right before \u2014 before we invest more on promoted opportunities on Maps.\nDan Salmon (BMO Capital):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of\n[clarification: Bank of America] Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):\u200b Great. A few for Ruth. First, I wonder if you could comment at all on the Cloud business profitability, medium- or long-term, how you're thinking about that. Second, I'll go ahead and take a shot at the EC decision lately. It clearly is material for financials. How are you thinking about approaching that decision, and does that impact any of your other advertising businesses as far as innovation? And then finally, any thoughts on verticals that were \u2014 that were strong this quarter that supported the organic revenue growth? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b So on \u2014 as you know, we don't \u2014 we don't break out by product. You know, I'll add a bit more color on Cloud. We're clearly excited about the opportunity we have here and it does continue to drive sizeable revenue growth, as I said in my\n\n opening comments, as did Sundar, and we are seeing momentum in the business. I think the comment that Sundar made about the number of new deals over $500,000 increasing three times year-on-year gives you an indication of the momentum in the business. It's obviously not a financial forecast but it does display the traction we're having with Cloud in the market, and GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet. G Suite continues to have strong growth. So we're really pleased with \u2014 with what that means for both the longer-term trends and the profitability. We do believe that from, you know, the many years of investment we've already made in things like technical infrastructure and security, which operate with tremendous efficiency, that provides us with a benefit, but near term we\u2019re investing meaningfully in sales and engineering, service, support, continuing to expand out regions, you know, to make sure that we're delivering the best experience for our enterprise customers, and that's what we're really focused on.\nYou know, in terms of \u2014 I think your second question was the EC. There's really not much of an update there. We're still early in our analysis of the decision and the right next steps, and we do have time to notify the Commission of proposed remedies as well as to implement changes. You know, the main thing is we're very focused on helping users and advertisers and are reviewing our options. It's an ongoing legal matter so there's not much more to comment on on that one.\nAnd then the third question was \u2014\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):\u200b On verticals that were strong?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Yeah. In terms of \u2014 you know, I think that what you're trying to get at here on what are we seeing in particular with \u2014 with Sites revenue, and there's not any one thing to call out, whether it's by vertical or steps that we're taking, and that's really what I would point you to more. I think it's an important point that we're very excited about the opportunities here, given both the underlying secular trends broadly with mobile \u2014 Sundar has talked a lot about that \u2014 but also all that we're able to layer on top of it, just given the engineering acumen here. And we talked about this on prior calls. It's true again here this quarter that no one change has been driving the results, and so what you're seeing is the combined benefit of a number of changes we've made. It's really this maniacal focus on all elements of the user and advertiser experience, and nothing to call out by vertical.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): \u200bThank you, Ruth. Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open.\nMark May (Citi)\u200b: Thanks for taking my questions. I think the first one is for Sundar. Data, of\n\n course, is a key differentiator in digital advertising. I was hoping that maybe you could talk about how you've changed your use of Google Search data recently in areas outside of Search and how that is or might impact the effectiveness of advertising on channels like YouTube and others, you know, outside of Search. And then Ruth, in your prepared remarks you mentioned tremendous growth in Mobile Search in the quarter. I think that's a more emphatic statement than in recent quarters. Hoping that maybe you could provide more color on some of the areas where you're seeing the change in growth trajectory coming from within Mobile Search. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b\u200b On your first question, you know, obviously, you know, we \u2014 we do these things with the foremost thing being making sure we do the right things for user privacy, but within our \u2014 within our own products, you know, we are trying to help users get a better experience across on the consumer side and the advertising side, and I think there is \u2014 there is opportunity there. And so, you know, we'll be thoughtful as we move forward.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bAnd then on Mobile Search, we \u2014 you know, I think what you're hearing is we're really pleased with the ongoing efforts there, and as I've \u2014 as I just said, there was no one change that really drove this. What's extraordinary about the team is with the focus on users and advertisers, what \u2014 you know, what is it that is most useful.\nSundar spoke about some of them with local, but it's really, again \u2014 it's a lot of small incremental efforts that, in the aggregate, continue to enable us to benefit from what's a really nice underlying secular trend here, and \u2014 and that's \u2014 that's what we're seeing in the results again.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from \u2014\nMark May (Citi): \u200b Nothing around \u2014 are you listening to this? There's nothing around like\ngeography or platforms or...\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b I'm not sure if that was directed to me or \u2014 but in terms of geography, I think one of \u2014 hopefully one of the benefits of the way we've recast the data here last quarter was so you can actually get a bit more insight into what's going on around the globe, and that's why I made the comment that we're having really broad strength globally. You can see it in each one of the regions here. U.S. continues to deliver strong growth, engagement across products. If you look at EMEA, you know, on a fixed FX basis, up 21%. You can see the same in APAC, the same in other Americas. So, yes, there is broad-based strength across \u2014 across geographies and I think, you know, as \u2014 I'm not calling out one particular area because the \u2014 what you're seeing here is the secular trend. I've used that term a couple of times now. And we're continuing to benefit from that around the globe and we're continuing to benefit from, on top of that, the efforts of our team.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n\n Stephen Ju (Credit Suisse):\u200b Okay. Thank you. So Sundar, I'm just wondering if you can give us some sense of advertiser adoption, particularly among your retail clients for the Store Visit product, as it seems like there is still a large opportunity to drive offline purchasing. And Ruth, can you give us some sense of any headwinds you might be seeing in your streams of revenue away from Play or GCP in the L&O revenue line as we're just not that accustomed to seeing a sequentially flat revenue line there. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b \u200bOkay. I spoke about it in my opening remarks but I \u2014 you know, since Store Visits Measurement was announced three years ago, advertisers have measured over 5 billion store visits globally, and I think, you know, we are \u2014 you know, we have just barely scratched the surface. At our Marketing Next in May, we announced that the Store Visits Measurement will also roll out for YouTube TrueView campaigns, and we'll be rolling out Store Sales Measurement in the coming months so advertisers can actually measure in-store revenue in addition to Store Visits delivered by Search and shopping ads.\nSo we've had, you know, good proof points. Advertisers who have used it \u2014 you know, for example, Virgin Holidays used it, factored in Store Sales Measurements, and they realized their Search campaigns generate double the profit compared to looking at online KPIs alone. So I think there's a lot of opportunity there, and \u2014 and, you know \u2014 and so, you know, we'll do \u2014 we'll do more there over time.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b And then you asked on the Other Revenue line. It was up nicely again this quarter, up 42% year-on-year, and that obviously includes the impact of FX. It's obviously a mix of businesses, including some of our bigger investment areas, most notably Cloud and Hardware. And as I said at the outset, Play continues to perform really well.\nI think if you are asking about the quarter-on-quarter sequential you noted, we're talking about a mix of businesses that have different characteristics, and to state the obvious, Play is more hit-driven, it's highly seasonal, Hardware is also seasonal, so, you know, the year-on-year provides a better sense of the dynamics of the business, and that's what you can see in this line up year-on-year really nicely this quarter.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): \u200b Okay. Thank you. Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bThank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (RW Baird): \u200b Thank you. Maybe just one question for Sundar. I wonder if you could update us on your thoughts regarding the convergence of Chrome and Android operating systems, and in particular, I'm curious whether the emergence of Google Assistant and voice as a corollary across devices is a reason to move forward with more integration between the two platforms. Thanks.\n\n Sundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b \u200bLook, I'm \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 we've been thoughtfully doing it, you know, putting users first and, you know, I'm excited at how Android apps are coming to Chromebooks, and we see there is a great opportunity and I think that will help us deliver the \u2014 you know, deliver a very compelling experience. And we just have started doing it this year, and I expect it to really get momentum as we go through to next year. So, you know, that's an example of convergence and I think that will work really well, and so \u2014\nAnd in terms of products like Google Assistant and voice, you know, I think we will make sure for users it doesn't matter. And that they work across every platform they use, including our platforms as well as other people's platforms. So, you know, we think about making sure our services reach as many users as possible, and so we are working on that as well.\nColin Sebastian (RW Baird): \u200bThank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200b Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John\nBlackledge of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.\nJohn Blackledge (Cowen): \u200bGreat. Two questions. So for Sundar or Ruth, within Cloud, could you talk about your view of G Suite's enterprise penetration right now, kind of key drivers of adoption longer term, and if you view it as a potential differentiator for Google Cloud versus other large competitors? And then within YouTube, 60 minutes per day of viewing on phones and tablets is obviously incredible at that scale. Any thoughts on, you know, kind of what could drive further material viewing or engagement growth over time? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b\u200b You know, maybe on YouTube, I would say, you know, YouTube is one of those products which, you know, is scaling really well globally, just like Search did, and, you know, we are seeing real strong growth on mobile and we're seeing real strong growth for YouTube on emerging markets as well. And we are seeing real strong growth on television. So if I look at YouTube on mobile, on emerging markets, on larger screens, they all look like newer opportunities, and so I think \u2014 I think there's a lot more growth ahead.\nAnd on Cloud, you know, I think we've kind of answered it. You know \u2014 you know, obviously we see differentiated strengths in machine learning, data analytics, security, and reliability, and the combination of not just GCP, G Suite working together with GCP, you know, we are seeing increasing win rates and adoption across enterprise customers.\nAnd I also think all the investments we're doing in terms of broadening our ecosystem, including the newer partnerships with the companies I mentioned earlier, that should begin to pay off. And overall, the return on investment from the hiring and region expansion we are doing. So I think we are \u2014 we are set up incredibly well and look forward to the momentum ahead.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for\n\n today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations:\u200b Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2017 call. Thank you and have a good day.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll hand the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Ellen. We had a terrific quarter. Revenues of $27.8 billion were up 24% year-on-year, and also up 24% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefitted from strong performance in Sites, which was powered by tremendous results in mobile search. Healthy growth in Network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. We also benefitted from substantial growth in Other Revenues from Cloud, Play and Hardware.\nOur outline for today\u2019s call is: first I\u2019ll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Next, I will review results for Google, and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.\nLet me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $27.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $255 million, or $64 million after the impact of our\n\n hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year.\nTurning to Alphabet revenues by geography, performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were $12.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $9.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year in both reported and fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year, and up 31% in fixed FX terms. Other Americas revenues were $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year, and up 32% in fixed FX terms.\nOn a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, were $11.1 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content-acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube; and Hardware related costs.\nOperating expenses were $8.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The year-on-year expense growth, in part, reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. As discussed previously, this change in SBC grant timing affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017, with elevated year-on-year expense growth in the first half of the year, but benefits the year-on-year comparisons for Q3 and Q4.\nStock-based compensation totalled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 78,101, up 2,495 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.\nOperating income was $7.8 billion, up 35% versus last year and the operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was $197 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the third quarter. Net income was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.57.\nTurning now to capex and operating cash flow. Cash capex for the quarter was $3.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $100.1 billion, of which approximately $60.5 billion, or 60% is held overseas.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $27.5 billion, up 23% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and\n\n AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.4 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play and Hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion, or 23% of total advertising revenues, and up 32% year-over-year. The increase in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas -- namely mobile search and programmatic -- carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the Sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites. The increase in the Sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totalled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. Operating income including the impact of SBC was $8.7 billion, up 29% versus last year, and the operating margin was 32%. Accrued capex for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.\nLet me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the third quarter, Other Bets revenues were $302 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $812 million for the third quarter. Other Bets accrued capex was $77 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q16.\nWe\u2019re pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates: Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches, including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat. Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services. Waymo continues to expand its geographic presence. It announced this morning that it will commence winter testing in Michigan to build on our progress to date addressing the challenge of autonomous driving in cold weather, particularly with snow, sleet and ice. Michigan is the sixth state where Waymo is testing its self-driving vehicles. Over the last eight years Waymo\u2019s cars have self-driven in more than 20 cities. With Loon, we were pleased to announce just last week that the team is collaborating with AT&T to deliver emergency internet service to the hardest hit parts of Puerto Rico.\nLet me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, in terms of revenues, results this quarter again reflect our relentless focus on innovation which is growing our advertising revenues. I frequently highlight our culture of innovation. In that regard, the most important point is that we are data-driven, with an extraordinary team of engineers,\n\n product managers and designers who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences. This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve. Our teams work relentlessly to anticipate and adapt to the expanding capabilities of both software and hardware. Further, our culture of innovation is building our non-advertising revenue streams in Cloud, Play and Hardware. Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of Hardware products, bringing the best AI, software, and hardware together and building on the first generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year. Longer-term, we remain excited about the opportunities in our Other Bets, with ongoing progress.\nSecond, with respect to profitability we continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins. Pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues. In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. We expect Sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of Sites revenue. As we\u2019ve frequently stated, we remain focused on profit dollar growth and these areas are additive to our growth.\nThe other cost of revenues associated with our non-advertising businesses is also affected by product mix. In the fourth quarter in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and holiday seasonality.\nOn operating expenses, we remain committed to investing to support our growing product areas. The more modest opex growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend, with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter. In particular, we\u2019re committed to sales and marketing investments in Q4 for the important holiday season. The most significant uptick in marketing will be to support our new, expanded Hardware line which was just announced at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In addition, we are investing to support YouTube and our other platforms.\nThird, as to Capex, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power for machine learning which is an asset across Alphabet, as well as to support Cloud, Search and YouTube growth. In conclusion, a great quarter. Thank you and let me now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thank you, Ruth. We had another great quarter. I\u2019ve been really proud of the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing to grow our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day. Even though we're in the early days of AI, we're already rethinking how to build products around machine learning. It is a new paradigm compared to mobile-first software.\n\n And I\u2019m thrilled how Google is leading the way.\nConsumers can already experience how AI allows them to interact with computing more naturally than ever before. Computers are adapting to people, rather than people needing to adapt to computers. Fundamental to this experience is Google Search and the Assistant. We introduced the Assistant last year, and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world. Walmart and Target have recently integrated with Google Home, which means you can order everyday items from them much more easily.00 million people now use the machine-learning smarts of Google Photos to manage and share their memories. The billion-plus people using Google Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information, like how to find parking where they\u2019re going. And businesses are seeing how AI can help them grow. Our open-source software TensorFlow is allowing anyone to use machine learning to solve problems, even in industries like agriculture. Researchers recently used TensorFlow to make smartphones able to identify disease in cassava plants, a major food source in the developing world.\nWe made TensorFlow open-source and free, because we fundamentally believe in creating computing platforms that developers can customize and build on. I\u2019m really pleased with the way our computing platforms like Android and Chrome have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world, and powering devices from more than a thousand brands worldwide. This quarter, we released the latest operating system, Android 8.0, and released a preview of ARCore which brings augmented reality to existing Android phones. Last week, we announced a partnership with Samsung to bring ARCore to all Galaxy devices.\nEven though it\u2019s been an incredibly busy few years, and technology is moving rapidly, at our core we remain an information company. Our mission to provide useful information to people in every corner of the world is unchanged. We care deeply about the quality of information we provide, and constantly work to get this right. As technology evolves, we have to evolve with it to ensure quality information can flourish.\nOur teams are making a big effort to support journalists and other people who produce high-quality information around the world. We are supporting publishers as they decide the right approach to free articles and subscription content. We\u2019re moving away from First Click Free to a more flexible model of content sampling. And we\u2019re working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solution for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers.\nAs new threats arise, we\u2019re committed to protecting journalists and media organizations from hacking and denial-of-service attacks. For example, we just launched the Advanced Protection Program for Google Accounts, which is designed to protect the accounts of those most at risk of targeted attacks, including journalists and other public figures.\n\n To wrap up my overview, I\u2019m thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day.\nNow let\u2019s review our three big bets, starting with YouTube. YouTube continues to see phenomenal growth as the premier global destination where people go to watch video. Three of the key areas we\u2019re focused on are -- strengthening the existing community, continuing to drive growth and expanding our subscriptions business. On the community side, we are helping create meaningful interactions that bring creators and fans closer together. This quarter, we launched a new feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app, so the minute you see a video from a creator you love, you can share the fun with friends and family.\nWe\u2019re also seeing significant growth in other areas. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, YouTube now has over one and a half billion users. On average, these users spend 60 minutes a day on mobile. But this growth isn\u2019t just happening on desktop and mobile. YouTube now gets over 100 million hours of watchtime in the living room every day. And that's up 70% in the past year alone.\nWe are continuing to invest in new subscription-based monetization models. YouTube Red, our first foray into the subscription market, is on track to release over 40 original shows this year. And YouTube TV, our live TV subscription service, continues to expand into new markets -- it now covers two-thirds of U.S. households and is available in 50 metro areas.\nNow onto Google Cloud. We continue to make progress winning over enterprise customers. Customers tell us they\u2019re switching to Google Cloud Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine learning, our commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes which runs in both cloud and hybrid environments, and our leadership in security. Just yesterday, we announced a new partnership with Cisco. We are collaborating on an open solution that gives customers an easy approach to the Cloud, enabling them to run apps that span both on-prem environments and Google Cloud Platform. G Suite, our collaboration and productivity applications, are leading the industry. We've made improvements to Drive, Docs, and Gmail, launching new features to help teams work better together. Nielsen recently moved to G Suite and said it's a great productivity and collaboration tool for their modern workforce. All of these things are driving momentum with customers and partners. Companies like Kohl\u2019s, PayPal, Rolls Royce Marine in Europe, and popular messaging app Hike in India moved to Google Cloud. We also announced a new partnership with Marketo, and expanded our relationships with Pivotal and VMware. To support our growing global customer base, we introduced two new regions in the quarter in Sao Paulo and Frankfurt, and continue to grow our go-to-market team.\nNext, our hardware business. Earlier this month we launched our second generation family of Made by Google hardware products, built with AI at the core. Last year, we focused on building the foundation to launch a line of devices made by Google. This year, we are focused on bringing together the best AI, software, and hardware to give people a great user experience.\n\n For example, the new Google Home Max is a smart-speaker powered by the Assistant. It has AI-based Smart Sound, which adapts the audio experience to the user\u2019s environment, context, and preferences. The new Pixel 2 has the world\u2019s best smartphone camera and a useful feature where you can summon the Google Assistant by just squeezing the phone. To get these devices in people\u2019s hands, we\u2019re also focused on scaling our go-to-market strategy. We\u2019re investing more in marketing, we\u2019re launching in more countries, and we\u2019re offering these devices in more retailers. And we\u2019re already seeing results -- pre-orders of Pixel on day one this year were more than double what they were last year. Also this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help accelerate our hardware business by bringing on a team of talented engineers. This deal lays the foundation for our continued efforts next year.\nAnd our advertising platforms continue to drive great results for our partners. While mobile has given rise to an unprecedented amount of data and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers. But even as we give advertisers incredible scale and reach across our ad platforms, we know consumer attention is scarce. That\u2019s why we are pleased YouTube ads continue to deliver the highest viewability rates in the industry. YouTube now has a 95% ad viewability rate, which is significantly higher than the average 66% viewability rate of other video ads. We continue to see the industry shift to 6-second bumper ads and saw great adoption this quarter from brands like Bayer, Ben & Jerry's, Louis Vuitton and Volvo.\nAnd Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners get online and grow their business. On our last earnings call, I mentioned a free website builder for small businesses. During the quarter, more than one million small businesses used it to build websites, helping many of them get online for the first time. We also introduced Local Posts, which allow small business owners to easily post their latest updates -- like upcoming events, special offers and new arrivals -- right on Google Search and Maps.\nOur commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we build products that all businesses can succeed with. That mission also has a geographical dimension, and I wanted to say a word about the momentum we are seeing in Asia. Our revenues are up significantly in the region, driven by the great results we\u2019re driving for existing and new advertisers. That holds true across developed markets like Japan, and emerging markets like the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which have seen the number of active advertisers grow by 25% or more in the past 12 months. And this growth is bringing tremendous benefits to our partners there. In the past three years, we\u2019ve paid out more than $24 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners in Asia-Pacific. And to help millions of people, we\u2019re building products specifically designed for local markets in Asia. In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce app, that already has more than seven and a half million users who have made more than 30 million transactions. I\u2019m really excited about the potential this brings for India\u2019s mostly cash-based economy.\nAs I said at the start, it\u2019s been a great quarter for Google. Just two weeks ago, I was in\n\n Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opportunity to countless businesses. It was amazing to see firsthand the transformative impact that information is having in schools, in the workplace, and for local business. As I said then, I remain a technology optimist. Not only because I believe in technology, but because I believe in people. I want to thank all the Googlers who continue to work so hard to advance our mission, and to help people everywhere. Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if would like to ask a question at this time, please press star and then the number 1 key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered, or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One, we see a lot of partnership announcements intra-quarter on the eCommerce side with Google Express and voice assisted shopping on Google Home. I wanted to understand better your ambitions in eCommerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feed back into the advertising business. Second question would be about the cash on the balance sheet and so how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid about today. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Maybe I'll take the first question and give it to Ruth on the cash question. You know, we are very excited about the partnerships, we are getting here with large retailers, and, you know, we are seeing traction globally. You know, we've obviously partnered with them through our advertising products. But with shopping, especially as we move on to making shopping more seamless across mobile and newer computing categories like Google Home, I think there's tremendous interest here.\nSo we -- you know, we are just getting started, and, you know, I think you will see us make a lot more progress and have a lot more announcements. And I think we are going to be relentlessly focused on making the buying experience much more seamless for users. So, you know -- so there's a lot more to come.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of your second question, there was really no change from the approach we\u2019ve talked about previously as we think about capital allocation. The priority is organic as you said in your question. We have a host of really exciting opportunities and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one. The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense. We're pleased to have added on, you know, HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been an important part of our history. And then the third is the return of capital and, you know, no change or update there in terms of how we think about that.\n\n Eric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Great. Thanks, two questions, please. Sundar, you talked about APAC. You called out Asia, and we noticed that too, that your year-over-year growth rate was higher than -- it was the highest since, at least, you have been disclosing it. And you provided the whats but any whys as to why that growth is accelerating? Is that something that has just naturally reached a tipping point? Is there something different that Alphabet, Google, has done in Asia to accelerate that growth?\nAnd then Ruth, can I ask you, you talked about the factors driving TAC and you mentioned changes in partner agreements. Is there any way you can give us any more color? Did you just renew some major partner agreements and there's nothing of that magnitude in the next year or should we just assume that this is just part of operations, there was nothing major recent, you could have major ones coming up. Just something to help us qualify. I don't think you had used that language before and what that indicated. Thanks a lot.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, the Asia question, largely, I think, we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time. Our products are very heavily used there, and so we worked hard to build -- build a user base. And then the -- mobile transformation is a secular shift there. That's definitely driving accelerated growth.\nAnd it creates a virtuous cycle. We see new advertisers coming on. We are investing more in Asia as well in addition to our go-to-market teams. We are building out great product and engineering teams. That's what has led us to improve core products like Search, Maps, YouTube, et cetera, to work better in those regions. And, you know -- and also launch region-specific products like Google Tez in India. So I think overall that's creating a good virtuous cycle, and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And on your TAC question, as I indicated in the opening comments, there were a couple of drivers here. One is changes in partner agreements, and I think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships across the mobile ecosystem. And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, which we've talked about a lot, and the fact that it carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. I think the most important point is that what you're seeing is we have a very healthy mobile business, search business, and it is growing substantially and our focus remains on long-term revenue and profit dollar growth.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Okay. Thank you.\n\n Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, Ruth, you talked about the ongoing advertising innovation, and it's pretty clear that that's happening in mobile, which seems like it probably accelerated in the quarter. So I was hoping you could comment on that. But then, also, how do you think about where you are in terms of optimization on mobile relative to desktop? And then just second on YouTube, I was hoping you could comment on the extent to which you're seeing marketers return to the platform post the brand safety issues of 2Q, and for a few of those who may not be back on yet, what are they looking for to fully return? Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So it felt like I -- on a number of calls I talked about the fact that there was no one item that was driving the momentum we saw in our Sites revenue, and that was the point of giving you a bit more color here. You know, we are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend but wanted to give you more color on what we mean by a culture of innovation. And that's really why I tried to go into a bit more about the rigor of the process.\nAnd one of the key points is that we do have the opportunity and we anchor this in data. We're constantly challenging assumptions, we're running a lot of experiments to enhance user and advertiser experience, and the approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry evolves as user behavior evolves. And so what users wanted in the earlier days of smartphones when screens were smaller is obviously very different from expectations users have today. Each quarter the ads team introduces more than a hundred enhancements out of a much larger pool of assumptions that they've tested. Machine learning is at the center of our processes and systems, and we do remain excited about the potential.\nYou know, desktop I commented on. You know, we are pleased with the ongoing strength of the business. It delivered solid revenue growth. It remains an important form factor for certain more complex tasks. We've talked about that in prior quarters, things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And so I think with, the strength here underscores the importance of desktop for many years in many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile for users.\nAnd then, in terms of YouTube, you know, I think you asked it well. We have been doing a lot to protect the ecosystem and do the right things for advertisers and users and content creators, and the overwhelming majority of advertisers never left, and those who did, many are already back on the platform.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thank you, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\n Heather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you so much. Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us your thoughts on voice search. And I guess in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google's lead as the way we search changes and as we see increasing adoption of these voice enabled digital assistants in the home. And part of this I guess I'm also wondering about is how do you think about your relationships with the partners? And if the device base broadens out, does your leverage with the partners change? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: It's a good question, Heather. Voice -- It's important to remember voice is one input. When you look at how customers interact, they obviously, you know, are interacting more and more naturally, seamlessly across a set of screens. Computing works in context for them. And even when they ask voice queries the response always what they need is not voice alone. Think about walking into a store, and if you could only ask using voice and the person has to reply in voice what all is in the store. So that model applies. So we expect, you know, a lot of continual experiences across screens, across modalities. So it's a big opportunity. I think it's opening up newer ways in which we are working with partners. I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences we are now able to drive at Walmart and Target which we couldn't have done a year before, thanks to voice, how we are using it in the Google Assistant and how we are driving these partnerships.\nSo there's a lot of excitement about how we can do all of this differently. So we are using this as a good way to rethink everything we are doing with the caveat that voice still, you know, overall is an emerging category compared to how users use their products. So there's a lot of room ahead.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill\nLynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Great. I'd like to maybe discuss a couple of your growth businesses. First on Cloud. Maybe you could talk about some of the wins you're seeing and why people are necessarily choosing Google and the momentum there. And then, secondly, on the hardware business, it's a little confusing on what your real goal is there. Is that to build a real independent separate hardware business? And how the Android relationships are going around that. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, first on Cloud, you know, effectively we are seeing strong momentum, and we already hear from customers that we have outstanding technology. So the reason we win deals in many cases is because we have superior technology. And people also see the room ahead thanks to our lead in machine learning, and that's an area where I think we'll continue to drive advantage.\n\n The main area where we need to get better is to scale our go-to-market and be in more places to effectively get more customers. And we are doing that a few different ways. You know, Diane and team have really scaled our global sales force, but more importantly, I think we are striking a lot of important partnerships with leading technology vendors to scale and reach more customers. And so be it the partnership with Cisco that we announced or in this quarter we also teamed up with Pivotal and VMware, and earlier in the year you saw us partner with SAP. And all of this helped customers more easily run their apps both on prem and in the cloud and we are doing this all in an open way with Kubernetes. So that's the overall strategy and I think that's really beginning to pay off, and you will see us scale across all of these dimensions for Cloud in the year ahead.\nIn terms of hardware, you know, we are very seriously committed to making hardware. Few reasons. You know, hardware is -- the intersection of hardware and software is how you drive computing forward. And historically, hardware has been maybe a single-device business. For a long while it was PCs and then maybe smartphones. But you're clearly entering an era where you're going to have different types of computing experiences. And so to do that and to stitch it all together across, I think it's important -- important we thoughtfully put our opinion forward. We are equally committed to working with the ecosystem, and we provide the same basis on both sides, you know, be it Android or Chrome, and it's going really well. In our close partnership this quarter across a set of Android partners, you see great momentum with the recently launched Samsung Note 8. We announced ARcore on Samsung devices. So we have strong momentum there as well. So we are committed to pushing forward hard on all of these areas.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.\nYour line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Great. I had a question for either Sundar or Ruth. It's just a philosophical question on TAC. So as the mobile search market matures, particularly in the western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to pay any TAC to partners at all? The lesson learned from the Firefox desktop, you know, partner loss a couple years ago was that you didn't lose any revenue and you stopped paying TAC on that agreement. Why wouldn't the same logic apply to mobile search? If not now, at some point in the future.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Look, I mean, first of all, we have a lot of experience in this area. We've been doing distribution deals for search for well over a decade and I have personally been involved all the way from the toolbar and the Chrome days. So by now, first of all we want to construct a win-win construct. So we always want a construct in which we do better when our partners do better. And so doing TAC well aligns us in that way and historically has driven a lot of growth. So it's a model we understand. We understand the key economics behind it. And so we are very thoughtful about how we drive it forward. So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth. And so I think we\n\n are pretty comfortable with how we're approaching it, and so we'll continue to do that.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one, a little bit on growing Alphabet's multi-app ecosystem. Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app installs and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms? Maybe talk about how you evaluate how you're doing there so far. And then bigger picture, you have many large and exciting investment and growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets. I'd be curious to hear philosophically how do you evaluate these opportunities and talk about some of the ROI thought processes or evaluation you make when making large capital allocation decisions?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: So on the first one, one of the unique things about how we approach product development is, we always at Google cared about building our products for everyone, and be it Search or Gmail or Google Photos or Chrome, you know, we work hard to drive it across all platforms.\nObviously some products, you know, the ability to make it work well on other platforms versus our native platforms, there are differences, and so -- you know, so we understand that. It's partly why we are very committed to driving success on our platforms, both through the ecosystem and our hardware efforts as well. So we think about it holistically, but you'll continue to see us put a lot of effort into other platforms as well. For example, over the past couple of years, I think we've meaningfully improved our products on iOS, as an example.\nOn the other part, maybe, Ruth, do you want to give color? I would just say at a high level, we drive our investments because we think about it from a user perspective first. We see areas where there are clear user problems, and we think about whether we can use computer science, and our technology advantage is Google and Alphabet to, you know, give a differentiated offering for users. So we do that, and then we think long-term. But that's how we go about it. Maybe Ruth can give more color there, too.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then the numbers flow out of that, which is we look over a multi-year period. A lot of the things we are doing are multi-year investments and that's why we stress repeatedly that we're looking at what are the long-term needs and opportunities that we can be addressing. If we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth, and those investments need to be seeded early for them to continue to grow and flourish around the globe, whether that responds to the first question on what's going on in APAC or across Alphabet more broadly. We take a multi-year look. We look at the business, technical, financial milestones along the way, and we allocate resources in order to make sure we're maximizing the long-term potential to deliver as we see is appropriate.\n\n Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of\nMoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (Moffett): Thank you. I have two for Sundar. One is on HTC. It's kind of interesting that you didn't buy the company but you bought talent. And I wonder what does that move directly give you, and what did you think was lacking, I guess, from the product side before you made that move? Then I have one on YouTube.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on HTC, we were -- you know, as we were working on our hardware efforts, we have been working with HTC very closely on the Pixel phones. So across the two companies, we saw a win-win construct by which we could bring the team and the IP and other assets related to the Pixel business in-house, and it also allows HTC to focus better on their phones and the other products they're working on. So it just made a lot of sense to do it. And I would also think about the overall capability we are getting not just to make phones but as we get into other product categories, like Google Home, VR, and so on, right? And so it's important to continue to build that out, and the talent we saw there is definitely best in class.\nMichael Nathanson (Moffett): Okay. And then on DirecTV -- sorry, YouTube TV, it's clear that you guys have pretty good momentum. 50 markets already. I wonder what has surprised you about the early consumer engagement? Is there anything you can share about early findings on the rollout of YouTube TV?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Yeah, main thing I would say is, you know, the consumer feedback, I think -- you know, there's always been this promise on being able to -- just like today on Google Search when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it. Bringing that kind of a seamless experience onto TV, when you think about something you want to watch, making it seamless. So improving that process I think is really what people positively comment on. Other things are being able to personalize it. Bringing our, you know, machine learning-based recommendations over time. So that's another area people notice. They get content which they're interested and surfaced much better. So I think given where we are, I'm really excited by the initial reception. And we are gathering a lot of feedback, bringing it to more markets, and are going to work hard at making the product better.\nMichael Nathanson (Moffett): Okay. Thanks, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I'd like to just follow-up on an earlier question about eCommerce and specifically a trend we see growing across the\n\n ecosystem of applying eCommerce data to targeting advertising. Maybe if you could describe how you view that at a high level and whether that's important to you, and growing that opportunity across all of your platforms, and perhaps shed some light on areas where you may be able to tap into that. You discussed partnerships with retailers, Android Pay. You're tracking offline conversions more. Even a product like Customer Match would seem like it would be an opportunity to have your advertisers bring that type of data to the table. Would love to hear a little bit more about your thoughts on that.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: It's a good question, Dan. You kind of partially answered it so you're welcome to come and work on our eCommerce team anytime. To us as a -- you know, as a vertical, you know, we see huge opportunities there. There's a lot of flywheel effects we see. Almost all eCommerce providers, like, are really interested in, like, Cloud for obvious reasons. So we see tremendous traction by which we are -- you know, we can talk to them about Cloud. They're already advertising partners. They're beginning to work with us much more closely on driving a seamless shopping experience. We're working on payments. And so it creates a nice flywheel effect. And we can do this globally across -- across all the countries we do it in. And so we are treating it, you know, more thoughtfully, and, you know, investing in addressing the vertical opportunity we see in front of us, and we'll continue working on that.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert\nBaird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (RW Baird): Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of follow-ups. First on TAC. Wondering if changes in partner agreements, since those are one of the key drivers of the increase in TAC, could we then see the rate of TAC growth moderate as you anniversary those deals? And then, secondly, as it relates to voice and visual search inputs, I know it's still early for Google Lens, but overall, wondering what portion of those search queries are proving to be incremental to Search, the search experience, or are they largely substituting for searches on screens? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on. We're pleased with our strong partnerships. We continue to stress the -- the impact from the shift to mobile. And again, both Sundar and I have said it. Our focus remains on the profit dollar growth, and we've got a really nice position in a strong growth area. So that's what you're seeing here. But as I also said, we do expect it to increase some from here. It's -- You've got a couple of factors going on.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on the second thing, look, I think based on every metric we see, users' information needs are only going up. And the amount of information they deal with are increasing. And as we add new modalities, it really drives, you know, a better experience for them.\n\n Google Lens, you know, there's a long way to go, but today as humans, visual input is really big for us. I mean, it's a lot higher bandwidth than everything else. And so bringing that to computing I think is a really important step in advancing how -- how users can, you know, process information. And so I see that as an important step and thanks to machine learning we'll be able to do these things a lot more powerfully. All of this I think overall adds to -- adds to the search experience. And, you know, so I view that as all incremental, but it will play out slowly over many years. And so we see this as a big opportunity ahead, and we are investing for it.\nColin Sebastian (RW Baird): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks. Good afternoon. The revenue growth was one of the highest growth rates you've seen in five years. I'm just curious if there was something that surprised you in the quarter or something that perhaps was an anomaly that we should be thinking about modeling going forward.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So I tried to give you a bit of color going across the major lines. We feel -- you know, we're really pleased with the Sites revenue growth, the performance in mobile, desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big categories, Network revenue also was quite strong. I think one thing to add there is programmatic continues to be a strong contributor, generate significant growth. We've talked about that on prior calls. You know, given all the ongoing advertiser adoption of programmatic buying, and AdMob continues to see strength. What you're also seeing here is the traditional AdSense businesses. You know, overall the pace of advertiser migration to programmatic affects this business kind of quarter-on-quarter, as well as the policy changes we've talked about in prior quarters. And those factors were less of a drag in the last couple of quarters, so you actually saw nicer revenue growth year-on-year here as well. It was up 16%. And then Sundar has talked a lot about the components of Other Revenues up nicely. We're really pleased with what's going on there. And then on top of that, Other Bets. So we've got a couple of components to it. I tried to give you color on each one.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of\nCredit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you. So, Sundar, can you talk about how Google is positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in the States? You talked about Tez in India, and that's the type of stuff\n\n we're not even seeing here in the States. So is there a broader opportunity for you to do a larger land grab with more products? And, Ruth, should we assume that the relative size of the dollar contribution to the Other Revenue growth happened in the order you gave out in the prepared remarks? I guess Cloud, Play, Hardware. And if so, this would make it the second quarter in the row in which Cloud is showing up as the largest contributor, I guess, as opposed the third. So any perspective you can share in terms of the relative growth you may be seeing recently? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on emerging markets, you know, we do see a differentiated opportunity there, partly because the characteristics of how truly many of these markets came mobile first I think gives rise to different ways users are -- users are adopting our products, and also more importantly, the ecosystem which it's built around. So for example, if you take eCommerce, the kind of models that are emerging in these countries are also a bit different. So I think we see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunity that they have, not just apply our global products there. So I think, you know, that's what led us to do Google Tez in India, and we'll thoughtfully look at opportunities in that region and invest a lot in the years ahead.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then we do -- we did list them in the order in which they're making a contribution. It's obviously a mix of businesses, and as we've talked about, we have very strong growth in each of -- of Cloud and Hardware. That was tempered by slightly slower growth in Q3 for Play reflecting what is the hit-driven nature of that business of gaming. But, you know, again feel really pleased with the progress, momentum that we're seeing in the various businesses. And I guess the only other thing to note is obviously seasonality on hardware as we move into the fourth quarter here.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for\ntoday. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.", "20174": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q4 2017 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q4 2017 Earnings Call February 1, 2018\nCandice (Operator): Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Inc. fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touch-tone telephone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's 4th quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. Undo reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them. During this call we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know we distribute our earnings release through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Ellen. We had a fantastic 2017 with total revenues of $110.9 billion, up 23% over 2016, and operating income of $28.9 billion, up 22% year-on-year, excluding the EC fine. Our momentum reflects a relentless focus on users, advertisers and enterprise customers as well as the benefits of our commitment to long-term investing.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-on-year. The ongoing very strong performance in Sites revenue, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Healthy growth in Network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Substantial growth in Other Revenues, namely Hardware, Cloud and Play, continues to highlight the benefits of our investments.\nOur outline for today\u2019s call is: First, I\u2019ll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. In order to facilitate comparisons of this quarter\u2019s results\n\n to prior periods, we have also provided the tax-affected line items excluding the impact of the US tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017. You can see the components in our earnings press release. Second, I will review results for Google, and then Other Bets. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.\nStarting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter:\ntotal revenues of $32.3 billion, were up 24% year-over-year, and strong across all regions. US revenues were $15.4 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.3 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In fixed FX terms, EMEA grew 22%, reflecting strengthening of both the Euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.7 billion, up 30% versus last year, and up 32% in fixed FX terms reflecting weakening of the Japanese yen. Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 31% year-over-year, and up 30% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strengthening of the Canadian dollar.\nOn a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; Hardware related costs for our expanded Made by Google family of products; and content-acquisition costs -- primarily for YouTube. Operating expenses were $10.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year in particular reflecting an increase in marketing spend given the holiday season.\nStock-based compensation totalled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 80,110; up 2,009 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.\nOperating income was $7.7 billion, up 15% versus last year and the operating margin was 24%. Other income and expense was $354 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our provision for income taxes on a reported basis includes $9.9 billion for items associated with the US tax legislation, resulting in a reported net loss of $3.0 billion and loss per diluted share of $4.35. Excluding the impact of the US tax legislation, our effective tax rate was 15%. Our net income was $6.8 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.70.\nTurning now to capex and operating cash flow: cash capex for the quarter was $4.3 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion with free cash flow of $6.0 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results.\n\n Starting with the Google segment, revenues were $31.9 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. Network revenues were $5.0 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other Revenues for Google were $4.7 billion, up 38% year-over-year, fueled by Hardware, Cloud and Play. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $6.5 billion, or 24% of total advertising revenues, and up 33% year-over-year. The increase in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas -- namely mobile search and programmatic -- carry higher TAC.\nTotal TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the Sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites. The increase in the Sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The underlying trend affecting the Network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC. Google stock-based compensation totalled $1.7 billion for the year (sic) [quarter], up 1% year-over-year.\nOperating income was $8.8 billion, up 11% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%.\nAccrued capex for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.\nLet me now turn and talk about Other Bets. I\u2019ll cover results for the full year 2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.\nFor the full year 2017, Other Bets revenues were $1.2 billion, up 49% vs. 2016, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $3.4 billion for the full year 2017, versus an operating loss of $3.6 billion in 2016. Other Bets accrued capex was $507 million, down from $1.4 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber.\nWe\u2019re pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates: Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter, across an expanded family of products in Energy, Safety and Security. In 2017, Nest products also became available in 12 new countries, more than double the number in 2016.\n\n Verily wrapped up its first field study seeking to reduce the transmission of diseases through mosquitoes with positive results. And just last week, Onduo, a joint venture between Verily and Sanofi, began a limited commercial launch of its diabetes management platform.\nAt Waymo, progress is accelerating. For example, Waymo surpassed 4 million miles of driving in the real world, taking only 6 months to achieve the last million miles compared to about 18 months for our first million miles. And, in November, Waymo announced that it is the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous - without anyone in the driver\u2019s seat.\nLet me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook.\nOur 23% revenue growth in 2017 was powered in particular by the ongoing extraordinary performance of our Sites business. Both mobile and desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation, with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience.\nAs we\u2019ve consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium- and long-term, which includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google -- Cloud, Hardware and YouTube.\nWith respect to Cloud, we are seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team bringing our advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning to more customers.\nAnd we\u2019re pleased with the momentum in our Hardware business in 2017, driven by an expansion in both our product line and geographic availability.\nFinally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer-term potential for our Other Bets businesses.\nOverall, operating income was up 22% year-over-year in 2017, excluding the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the rate of operating income growth quarter to quarter.\nWithin cost of revenues, the biggest component is traffic acquisition costs reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. While we expect Sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of Sites revenue reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites Revenue will slow after the first quarter of 2018.\n\n Within opex, we are keenly focused on prioritization in order to optimize the resources we are investing for longer-term growth. As I discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, marketing spend in the fourth quarter is significantly elevated, in particular supporting hardware but also across Cloud and YouTube.\nFor 2018, we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google in Cloud, Hardware and YouTube and our machine learning efforts which are powering innovation across our businesses.\nYou\u2019ll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D. With the closing of our deal with HTC earlier this week, for example, we\u2019ve added 2,000 employees to support our Hardware business.\nWith respect to SBC, we\u2019ve completed the transition to a single annual compensation cycle for employees, with a full-year equity refresh grant to employees in the first quarter of 2018. Our biannual grant to SVPs will also occur in the first quarter and you will see the combined step-up in our first quarter results.\nFor our Other Bets, in 2018 we will continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution paths.\nFinally, our framework for capital allocation, is unchanged from our prior discussions. The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic growth in the business. We\u2019re excited about the significant opportunities we\u2019ve identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately. We then layer in a sensitivity analysis regarding potential M&A as well as capex, in particular computing infrastructure, to support the needs of these growing businesses. The most sizable catalysts for added investment in compute power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet as well as additional requirements for Google\u2019s Cloud, Search and YouTube businesses. This framework further considers complementary uses such as a share repurchase. After taking these potential investments into account, our Board has decided to extend our share repurchase program up to an additional $8.6 billion of Class C capital stock.\nIn conclusion, 2017 was another great year and we are very excited about the opportunities ahead.\nI will now turn it over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks Ruth. Our teams are off to a great start in 2018. This year is special as it will mark 20 years since Google was founded. A lot has changed, but our mission -- organizing the world\u2019s information and making it universally accessible and useful -- remains the best guide for the next ten years.\n\n Technology is an incredibly dynamic industry. We\u2019ve been laying a foundation for the next decade as we pivot to an AI-first company, powering the next generation of Google products like the Google Assistant. And we have been making substantial investments in our three biggest bets -- Cloud, YouTube and Hardware. These bets have enormous potential, and already they are showing real momentum and gaining traction.\nToday, I\u2019ll start by sharing some of the exciting progress in these three big bets.\nFirst, Google Cloud. Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, has reached meaningful scale, and I\u2019m excited to share today that it\u2019s already a billion dollar per quarter business. In fact, we believe that Google Cloud Platform, based on publicly reported data for the twelve months ended December 2017, is the fastest growing major public cloud provider in the world. We are also increasingly doing larger, more strategic deals with customers. In fact, the number of deals worth over $1 million across all Cloud products more than tripled from 2016 to 2017.\nThe strength of our products and the value of working with Google is increasingly clear to partners and customers. In the fourth quarter, we forged new -- and deepened existing -- partnerships with industry leaders including Cisco for open hybrid environments, Salesforce for customer insights and productivity, and SAP for AI and data insights across their products. These collaborations span our entire companies from engineering integration to marketing programs to joint sales, and they cover Google Cloud Platform, G Suite, and Google Analytics. We also saw accelerating customer traction and our wins included global brands like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Dentsu Aegis Network, Keller Williams, Mattel and Tyco Retail Solutions. And underscoring the increasing importance of Google Cloud to the enterprise, we surpassed another new milestone -- 4 million paying customers on G Suite.\nNext, YouTube. Every month, more than 1.5 billion people come to YouTube to watch their favorite content on channels ranging from the Ellen Show, which has more than 22 million subscribers, to the NBA with over 8 million subscribers, to SciShow, a really popular educational channel, with more than 4.5 million subscribers. In fact, there are over one billion learning-related video views every day on YouTube; I learned that this week!\nWith all this great content, people are thinking of YouTube more as a key part of their TV viewing experience. For Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union, more partners used YouTube to livestream the address than ever before, generating five million live views. And just yesterday, we announced a partnership with Major League Soccer\u2019s LA Football Club. YouTube TV will be the exclusive home to watch all locally televised English-language matches, in addition to their original programming and content. YouTube TV is now also available on Roku. There is great momentum around the world, with localized versions of YouTube now in 90 countries in 80 different languages. Just this morning, we announced that we\u2019re expanding the popular YouTube Go app to over 130 countries around the globe. The app has great data usage transparency and controls built in, which is especially useful for people living in regions with\n\n limited connectivity. In the fourth quarter, we also strengthened our relationship with the music industry, signing new licensing deals with Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. We also partnered with Ticketmaster to help fans buy tickets to see their favorite artists perform live.\nThird, our growing hardware business. Our Made by Google hardware products were very popular this holiday season. Device shipments in the fourth quarter have more than doubled year-over-year. Our retail partners also saw strong performance. Our devices are available in stores like Best Buy, Target and Walmart. I\u2019m especially excited about the popularity of our Google devices for the home, like the Google Home, Mini, Max, and Chromecast. In the last year, we\u2019ve sold tens of millions of these devices and counting! I want to call out the great work of our marketing and design teams. Our hardware is beautiful -- individually and as a family -- and people love discovering the unique features like the built-in Google Assistant. Earlier this week, we officially closed our deal with HTC, which will bring great talent to drive even more innovation in the years to come.\nTurning to our efforts in machine learning. Our AI research and innovation leads the world. Our mission to better organize the world\u2019s information has been transformed by these technologies -- with our search products and the Google Assistant at the heart. There\u2019s great momentum around the Google Assistant as we bring it to more people on more devices. It\u2019s now available on more than 400 million devices, including speakers like Google Home, as well as Android phones and tablets, iPhones, headphones, televisions, watches and more. People love to use the Assistant on all these devices.\nThere was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at CES from partners and consumers, where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces, like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo, as well as Android Auto, which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai and Volvo.\nOne area that is really benefiting from our advancements in AI is photography. The Pixel 2 phone is the leader in video rankings by industry standards, with smoother and clearer videos thanks to machine learning and our video stabilization technique. And Google Photos continues to go from strength to strength. On New Year\u2019s Eve alone, over three billion photos and videos were uploaded to Google Photos.\nMore broadly, we want everyone to be able to use machine learning for their own needs. We recently gave Google Cloud customers access to AutoML, which makes it far easier to build complex neural nets. Since it launched a few weeks ago, over 10,000 customers have already signed up to try it.\nLastly, I\u2019ll give a quick update on our computing and advertising platforms. First, Android. To provide a better, more tailored experience for our next billion users, we made Android Oreo - Go edition available for our device partners. This year, we expect to see Go devices from dozens\n\n of manufacturers, and with great support from mobile operators and app developers around the world. I\u2019m confident this will bring the power of smartphones to many more people for the first time.\nGoogle Play is also growing well. Just last week, we introduced Audiobooks so you can now catch up on your favorite books anytime, on multiple devices. And in Latin America, the number of unique monthly buyers on Google Play grew by over 50% year-over-year in 2017. Chromebooks also continue to gain momentum and traction. Third party research tells us that fourth quarter sales of consumer Chromebooks in the US grew by over 70% year-over-year.\nMoving to our advertising platforms which help large and small businesses. As shoppers turned to their mobile phones this holiday shopping season, Google was central to helping them discover new brands, compare products, and find the best deals. We redesigned the mobile shopping experience on Google, bringing more product information to the forefront, like reviews and ratings. We\u2019re also making the payments experience simpler, safer, and more consistent. We brought our payments efforts together as the new Google Pay, which shoppers can use to pay online, in stores, and across Google products like Chrome and the Play Store. Companies like Airbnb and Instacart are using Google Pay to speed up mobile checkout. And HotelTonight found that customers using Google Pay are 65% more likely to complete their bookings.\nWe also have really strong momentum in app promotion ads. The majority of our app promotion campaigns are now using Universal App Campaigns, which is part of our focus on simplifying the advertiser experience. Additionally, we introduced a new playable ad format in Google Play that allows users to sample games before they install. Ads in Google Play are performing really well for developers. And our App Promotion business on YouTube is flourishing. We launched major initiatives such as Store Visit measurement and location-based ad formats to drive online-to-offline commerce.\nWe\u2019re focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers, while helping creators earn money from popular content. In addition to the significant work we\u2019re doing to protect users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago, we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred, and simpler controls for marketers. The feedback we have received from advertisers and creators so far has been really positive.\nSo as you can see, we\u2019re making great strides in our biggest bets, and I\u2019m proud of the work we\u2019re doing across the company. I\u2019m also incredibly proud that as Google grows, we are making significant contributions to our partners, the economy and our local communities. Our business continues to benefit our partners around the world. This includes news publishers, app developers and YouTube creators, who we share revenue with. Over the last four years, our partners have earned over $100 billion -- that\u2019s incredible, and we\u2019re working on new ways to drive even more value to our partners.\n\n In the US, specifically: we have offices and data centers across 21 states and we plan to hire thousands of people across the US this year. Last year in the US, we grew faster outside the Bay Area than in the Bay Area. To support this growth, we\u2019ll be making significant investments in offices across nine states, including Colorado and Michigan. We\u2019ll also be building or opening five big new data centers in the US. And with digital skills in high demand by employers, our Grow with Google initiative will help job seekers and small businesses gain education and skills to help them succeed. Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we\u2019re creating an IT support certification program that will give thousands of people scholarships and job opportunities. More than 10,000 people have already signed up, which is amazing.\nI want to thank all our employees, Google users, partners and advertisers around the world. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s in store for all of us this year. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you Sundar, and we will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star and then the number one key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. And to alleviate any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once you've asked your question. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, one for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that you're targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around the Assistant is sustained?\nAnd then, Ruth, looking at cost of goods sold, that came in quite a bit higher than we thought. And you were lapping a one-time charge, if we have it right, versus the year-ago period. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the pressures in cost of goods sold that were either seasonal or maybe a new normal in terms of a higher level going forward. Any color there would be really appreciated. Thanks, everyone.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Eric. On the Google Assistant and Google Home, we are very excited about the momentum we saw in CES. It actually reflects work we've been doing for a while. You know, Google Assistant in some ways brings together all the technology we've been building for years. And it's an extension and it's supported by Google Search as well. We're also thinking about our capabilities broadly beyond just one device alone. And that's what we're doing here across phones, across all surfaces. So that's something big we are\n\n focused on. And the second is we have always built ecosystems, be it Android or Chrome or Chromebooks. We work with many, many partners and scale up things, right? And so we are leveraging those best practices and trying to build this in a way in which the entire ecosystem can ship products with the Google Assistant and generate value. So I think -- I think the framework is great. And long-term, our investments in AI, you know, will directly manifest those capabilities for users through the Google Assistant. So I'm very bullish on it.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of the gross margins, it obviously reflects our product mix. And as you know well, the TAC rate for each of Sites and Network as a percentage of those revenue lines does continue to increase because they are our strongest growth areas; namely, mobile search and programmatic, and so carry higher TAC. But as I indicated in my opening comments, we do estimate that the year-on-year increase in the Sites TAC rate will slow after the first quarter of 2018. And then the other thing to note, other cost of revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, you know, having increased both the number of products in the Made by Google family as well as continuing to expand geographically in Western Europe and APAC. You can see that reflected here.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you so much. Two quick questions, one for Ruth and Sundar. I guess, Ruth, just to follow up on your comments there, the partner agreements which you just cited, is there any color you could give us on how these typically work? And what I mean by that is: are they typically multi-year deals on average? How do we think about these impacting the rate of change in TAC, since you were talking about the pace of growth in TAC as we look out, call it, in year two, if these are multi-year deals?\nAnd then for Sundar, I guess I wanted to follow up a little bit with what we saw at CES. But how do you think about voice? And given the significant number of devices in the market, how do you think in the future about traffic acquisition strategies on these devices as you look five years down the road? Is there any reason to think that the strategies might be different that you're going to follow as you look ahead than what we've seen over the past, call it -- you know, since the advent of the iPhone? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So on your first question, there's not much really that I'm going to be able to add there. I mean, given the ongoing momentum in our mobile search business, this does continue to be relevant as you look forward given mobile carries higher TAC. But the rate as per your question has also reflected changes in partnership agreements. So, you know, all factors considered, we expect the year-on-year increases will slow after the first quarter of '18. And as I've said on many of these calls, we are very pleased to have a very strong position in a rapidly growing market and that momentum does continue.\n\n I guess the only other thing to add is that Q4 TAC as a percentage of revenues does benefit from the fact that the fourth quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube. So quarter-on-quarter changes are less insightful because CAC is distinct from TAC is not in this number. But not much more to add there. Pass it to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And, Heather, on voice, you know, we're very excited by voice. We obviously see it being adopted strongly. In countries like India, it's actually a significant part of just mobile search queries in general. And, you know, things like Google Assistant and doing Google Home kind of really accelerates the trend. But, you know, we definitely see more multimodalities. So, you know, as you saw, we also announced many smart displays at CES. I think that will be an exciting trend as well. So we'll bet on all of that. In general, I think about -- you know, we want to be there for users when they need us, you know, and we want to serve everyone. This is why we work across the ecosystem. We do first-party devices. We do it globally. And so we're committed to doing that well. So, you know, I think it will be an extension of how we've approached search from day one and trying to serve everyone. And so I don't overall see a big shift.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your\nline is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thanks for taking the question. Some big news earlier this week just in terms of Waymo with FCA talking about delivering thousands of minivans to Waymo later in the year. So I was hoping, Ruth, you could just talk to us more about the timing for that business and how we should think about the economic model there as you move to operations and deployment phase.\nAnd then, secondly, the cash now obviously much more accessible in terms of what is held overseas. Can you just talk more about your plans there? Obviously the bigger -- the buy-back there, but still, you know, not meaningful in terms of the overall size of the company. Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Sure. So first on Waymo, we do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts, in particular the rider program in Phoenix we're excited about. And we're expanding our testing to more states.\nIn November we announced that Waymo's self-driving tech reached a major milestone becoming the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous. And that builds on our more than 4 million test miles driven in the real world in seven states, 25 US cities. We're currently driving -- self-driving, I should say, 10,000 miles every day with billions of miles in simulation and robust testing at our private facility.\n\n So more to your question, we do continue to explore a range of options beyond the program we're piloting in Phoenix, including, you know, ride sharing and personal use vehicles and logistics, deliveries, and working with cities to help them address public transportation objectives.\nThat being said, our first commercial application is a ride service that we will launch in 2018 that would be open to members of the public in Phoenix. And riders will be able to use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully driving -- self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel. So very excited about that.\nAnd then in terms of cash, you know, I think the main point as we think about it is there's no change in our approach to our capital allocation framework. We've consistently been focused on long-term investing. And we talked a lot about that already on this call. And our framework has been, therefore, very consistent. The priority, the first use, is organic. It's investing in the many opportunities that we have. And the second is strategic. And we do remain active with smaller M&A deals in particular to support our Cloud business and Hardware. You know the HTC deal, which we just closed, is a good example of that. Third is capex and we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google but in particular supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube, and all that we're doing in machine learning. And then, finally, that leaves return of capital. And, you know, when we considered all of that, that's what led us to extend -- to have the board extend the share repurchase program which we announced a couple of years ago. And, you know, we'll let you determine what that number represents in true Google fashion. But it's just a modest increase to what we've been doing previously.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thank you, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Ruth, you called out desktop search, I think, for the second straight quarter as being relatively strong. Could you just talk about some of the drivers of the strength of desktop? And how do you think about the sustainability of continued strong desktop growth into 2018 and beyond? The second one, a question on search query volume. There's often speculation and question marks around how consumer behavior is changing in eCommerce and whether Google is still capturing as many eCommerce searches. Can you just talk to what you're seeing in retail search query volumes and search user growth within eCommerce in the United States?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, overall, look we -- obviously search is very broad. And even when you talk about commercial things, we serve across many, many categories including things like -- you know, from travel to hotels and to services, to products and so on.\nSo we're very, very comprehensive. And, you know, obviously eCommerce is evolving a lot and\n\n we continue to invest there.\nYou know, Google Shopping is doing well and we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why as it evolves with Search and Assistant we partner with companies like Walmart, for example, to make it much easier to buy products and so on. So we invest a lot there.\nYou're right, consumer behavior is changing, but we're comfortable given the breadth of how we do things and how that -- you know, how we are focused on user experience there.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then on your question on desktop, you know, there really isn't one particular item to call out here. And that's why last quarter I tried to walk through the process that our team goes through and the way they look at innovation, really stepping back and recognizing that the way we all use smartphones and desktop is continuing to evolve. And so, therefore, there's utility and challenging assumptions about evolving user behavior and advertiser preferences. And that opens new lines of inquiry which benefits not just mobile but also desktop. And desktop did deliver solid revenue growth.\nIt does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And we're pleased with the ongoing strength. I'll leave it to you to do any of the forecasting. But we just view it as yet another valuable form factor and are really pleased with the performance there.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of\nEvercore. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore): Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, on YouTube, you mentioned the 1.5 billion people come to YouTube. Any other information you can give us there on user growth or engagement trends would be great. Anything on time spent, I mean, particularly as YouTube becomes more mature and mobile video, particularly North America, gets more competitive. And then also on YouTube, anything around new products or features driving the monetization or ad business.\nAnd then, Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth quarter. I think you said that the 4Q was significantly elevated. Should we interpret that to mean that the growth rate in selling and marketing year-over-year should decelerate off the 4Q? And then just related to that, are you getting a good return on investment from this marketing spend, particularly when you think about media mix and all the spend that we've seen on TV as compared to digital marketing? Thanks a lot.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, look, on YouTube, you know, we are continuing to\n\n see great momentum, maybe one area which, for example, highlights, you know, how well it's doing is if you think about YouTube on TV, people actually are watching YouTube on the big screen. Our growth has been significant there. And so increasingly people use YouTube for -- we see it being used across every possible use case.\nI said it earlier in the call. Everyday we get over a billion views on educational content alone. People use it to go catch up on sports, music, entertainment. And so, you know, you can think about the breadth of -- historically YouTube has been very strong on mobile and continues to be strong on mobile. It's doing particularly well in the next billion user markets. Our growth last year was very strong there, which is why we supported it with investments like YouTube Go. And we are seeing it now grow well beyond mobile, especially in the living room. So a lot of momentum there.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of sales and marketing, you know, as I said, it particularly supported hardware but was also supporting Cloud and YouTube. And as both Sundar and I said, these are important Google growth areas for us and we are investing to support growth in the business.\nThe elevated levels this quarter did reflect both seasonality and, you know, a strategic decision to invest in these brands. And so we view it as a very important part of the overall investment in what we view as very sizable opportunities. And it's both supporting the brand and the momentum, therefore, going into 2018. But, you know, this is a very specific product focus as well.\nAnthony Diclemente (Evercore): Okay. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I will go with a European theme. First, curious to hear your thoughts on the potential impact of GDPR. Maybe both on your own Sites and Properties and how any business practices may need to be adjusted for that but also for tools like customer match that your advertisers may use. And then second, I'll take a shot at it. Any updates on your dialogue with EU officials and regulators on the proceedings there? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, good question. I was just in Europe last week. It was exciting to be there. There's clearly momentum we feel in terms of how Europe is doing, and we are very committed to the region. We are opening new offices there. We announced an AI center. We committed to hiring more engineers and supporting staff there. So it's an important market for us.\nOn things like GDPR, you know, we want to be -- we've been thoughtfully engaged there. I think 14\n\n it's important to put privacy first for European citizens. And we are very supportive of the work that's underway there. And we are committed to complying with GDPR across all the services that we provide in Europe. There's still time. As a reminder, it doesn't go into effect until May or so. And we are working to make sure all our products are ready, and we'll work hard to make the transition well.\nIn terms of, you know, again, with -- with the European Commission, we have long had constructive conversations. We are understanding their concerns and responding with thoughtful changes, and we'll continue engaging in a thoughtful way.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Okay, great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert\nBaird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you. First, Sundar, your comments on Google Cloud were upbeat. And I wonder how much of the momentum there is related to machine learning capabilities offered as a service. If you could frame just how important that is for the Cloud business overall. And then as a follow-up, on Google Home or the voice-based Assistant, if there's any update in how you're thinking about monetization from a transactional perspective, transactional model, with perhaps retail partners? Or do you see an ad-based model emerging there as well? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On the first thing, Colin, on Cloud, you know, particularly last quarter, we obviously brought AutoML to our Google Cloud customers. To me that shows the rate at which we're bringing our internal advances. It's just a year ago I remember reviewing with the team when they first showed me the AutoML work. We spoke about it at Google I/O. And it's pretty cutting-edge work.\nAnd to turn it back around and to provide it for everyone in the world, I think that shows the power of what we can do with Google Cloud and get our state-of-the-art and get it to everyone. I think -- I think the momentum there, obviously, it's due to our strength in machine learning, the kind of open, agile development environment we provide, security, and then the combination with G Suite.\nBut above all, I think, you know, we've always -- you know, we've been doing cloud now for 19 years because Google itself was built on a cloud platform.\nBut where the momentum is really coming from is over the past two years, we put a lot of effort to make sure we are enterprise scale-ready. So now we can handle any type of enterprise, any kind of regulatory complexity, security complexity and so on. And that's evident in the business wins we are seeing.\n\n So we are signing customers who are very large across the board globally, and I think that's driving a lot of momentum there.\nOn your question on Google Home and voice-based Assistant and how we're thinking about monetization, there's a lot of interesting ideas internally. So we have -- teams that are excited about trying new things. We see a lot of potential.\nBut the guidance I have given the teams is to be squarely focused on user experience. We are really getting started. I think these are going to be powerful technologies.\nBut there are areas where we clearly feel, you know, all of us fall short for doing right by users and getting the expectation -- matching their expectation. So you'll see us focused on user experience there for a while to come.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of\nMoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks, everyone. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Both on YouTube. So first question was: As Google Preferred kicks up a little heat on perhaps the types of qualities that make the cut for your videos, do you feel you have to take a more active stance in looking at what is in Google Preferred -- sorry, in YouTube Preferred?\nAnd how are you going to go about that?\nAnd for Ruth, the past year was one where we heard a lot about brand safety. And I wonder when you look back at the YouTube results in '17, is there any noticeable signs of maybe a shift in ad spending from some of the brands who are making those complaints? So those are my questions.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Michael. I probably can talk about both as they're related. You know, we obviously want to make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and advertisers because it supports content creators.\nAnd, you know, we took a lot of steps last year but particularly in December we adopted a new rigorous approach, and that's the much more stringent standards for creators. For example, they need a thousand subscribers to be eligible for monetization.\nWe are manually reviewing Google Preferred videos. We obviously use machine learning to support that a lot, and they both go hand in hand. We have provided improved controls for marketers, and we're also working with trusted third-party vendors to assist brand suitability. So it's a comprehensive approach to make sure all of this works well.\n\n And so while there have been, you know, concerns but we're working really hard to address them and respond strongly.\nAnd so I think -- I think we are focused on the long-term opportunity here, and I think we are setting ourselves up well for the years ahead.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you, and our next question comes from Ken Sena of Wells Fargo\nSecurities. Your line is now open.\nKen Sena (Wells Fargo): Great. Thank you. So just a question on -- searches seems to be coming more qualified through travel as far as filtering the price that people want to pay, locations, amenities, et cetera. You know, is there any trend that goes along with that in terms of maybe depressing search volume growth to some extent because of the more filtered aspect? And then secondly, does the higher qualification trend tie in at all to the shifts towards programmatic in terms of other parties that might be involved or the discussion that we have had around TAC? And maybe, two, just as a follow-up, if you can provide, you know, just a little bit more color on Google Pay in terms of what might be different in this round versus previous attempts. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Maybe I'm not fully sure I understood all the specifics there. But at a high level, you know, as people are on the go, they're traveling, et cetera, if anything, I think Search is more invaluable than ever before. All the work we do in local searches applies incredibly when you travel. The properties we have like Google Maps, et cetera, go along with it. So overall, I think they all add up to a better user experience and, hence, a better opportunity for us.\nGoogle Pay turns out to be an important part of all of this. You know, as we move from just answers to helping users complete actions over time, including transactions, their ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it, which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy.\nKen Sena (Wells Fargo): Okay. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit\nSuisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thanks. So, Sundar, I think Ruth cited hardware in the prepared remarks as the largest contributor in the fourth quarter for the Other Revenue line. As you look at the roadmap going forward, you acquired the HTC engineers to bring that team in-house. It looks like for the first time you have an integrated hardware and software team under one roof. So how do you think your product development pace and strategy will change for smartphones\n\n and other devices going forward? And also, does it make sense to bring the Nest team to be more integrated into core Google as well given the drive to increase the touchpoints for all the Google products to other form factors? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Stephen. Great question. You know, you're right that part of the reason we're so excited about being able to bring this world-class team in-house is while we've been working together already, we've had to straddle, you know, a company boundary to do that. But now having them as Googlers will really make that integrated development which is so critical -- critical, you know, for us to do it better.\nYou know, we bring a unique approach to hardware, the combination of AI plus software plus hardware, so being able to get those teams working together I think would really drive the pace forward. And the best example of that is you see the advances we've made with both, you know, still and video photography on our phones.\nAnd, you know, the Nest team is very -- very closely aligned with the Google hardware team. We work hard to realize a lot of synergies there. We already share a lot of our go-to-market efforts and we increasingly are collaborating on product development as well. So we collaborate closely and, I'm excited at the possibilities there as well.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill\nLynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Merrill Lynch): Great. Thanks. First for Sundar, it didn't feel like there was many visible search changes this year as far as coverage or ad formats. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on search innovation pipeline as you look out to '18 and key growth drivers going forward.\nAnd then, Ruth, in the prepared remarks, there was a lot of comments on investment in your medium-term business growth drivers, offices, data centers, and other areas. Just wondering if you view 2018 upcoming as an investment year or kind of more of the same of what we've seen over the last couple years. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Justin, when you think about search, one of the ways I would encourage you to think -- we think about user journeys. So a lot of the innovation that we are doing has gone on to not just an individual query and how we respond but how we think about what a user is trying to accomplish over a series of sessions. Are you trying to plan a trip? And how do we do it better? Do you have a health-related area where you are trying to learn more about it? And how do we help you through that?\nAnd so it's not always just changing a specific format but understanding context better and\n\n bringing you that information through a journey. And I think so -- there's a lot of innovation that's happening in that direction.\nAnd, also, underlying is what I said earlier, it's not just providing the answers. How do you help them get to that information and act on it? And so maybe you found something and you want to call that place or maybe you're trying to order a birthday gift and we actually want to go a step further and help you buy that gift. So that's along the lines. And the innovation is happening across Search and Assistant in an integrated way.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of your investment question, you know, we've consistently been investing across Alphabet and we've tried to be very clear about our investment priorities, you know, all with a view to supporting healthy, long-term growth that goes back to the inception of the company. The year-on-year op inc growth that you\u2019ve seen does include the sustained investments for all the areas that both Sundar and I have talked about, for the year up 22% versus last year. Obviously a lot of variability in growth quarter-to-quarter.\nAnd we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support growth of the business. The fourth quarter does reflect the obvious seasonality. And, again, we continue to look across the various products at their needs and try and prioritize. But we remain committed to long-term growth.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nBen Schachter (Macquarie): Just a couple of questions. Can you discuss the evolution of the business model for Waymo? You're launching the ride-hailing service in Phoenix. You have worked with manufacturers. You talked about other models. But when you think about the sort of five- to ten- year view of that, what will the primary business model look like? Separately, can you talk about what is interesting from a strategic point of view about the video game business? You're making some key hires there. Just wondering what you think Google can bring to that industry that would be innovative. Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So on Waymo, you know, really not much more to add. We're really pleased after years of work on technology where it was really about safety, safety, safety, and developing the technology and the platform. And now we're in a position where we have this opportunity to let people use and benefit from what we've developed. I think that safety has been a key driver. And the opportunity for cities has been really exciting, what it means about optimizing resource space that they have. So it's still very early days, and we are just -- we are pleased with all the progress the team has made. But it would be getting ahead of ourselves to go further out than what we have laid out here.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on the video gaming side, I think, look, we are maybe 19\n\n today have a lot of momentum in these areas, both with YouTube as a platform, Google Play. So, you know, these are, you know, assets which really work well. And we'll continue investing there. Nothing new or interesting to share with you at this time.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter call.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.\n", "20181": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q1 2018 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q1 2018 Earnings Call April 23, 2018\nCandice (Operator): Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet, Inc. first quarter 2018 earnings call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touch-tone telephone. And now I would like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements and they are made based on the assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them. During this call we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Ellen. We delivered ongoing, strong revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. The sustained outstanding performance in Sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Robust growth in Network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Ongoing substantial growth in Other Revenues, namely Cloud, Hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities. Our outline for today's call is: first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Second, I will review results for Google, and then Other Bets. As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.\nStarting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $31.1 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency\n\n impact on our revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of our hedging program.\nTurning to Alphabet's revenue by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. US revenues were $14.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 21%, reflecting strengthening of both the Euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were\n$4.8 billion, up 33% versus last year, and up 30% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Other America revenues were $1.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, and up 35% in constant currency.\nOn a consolidated basis, total Cost of Revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year. Other Cost of Revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.2 billion, up 39% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were: first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content-acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube; and finally, Hardware-related costs.\nOperating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in Cloud and Hardware, as well as the Assistant. G&A expense trends were affected this quarter by a number of factors. In particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily to other Cost of Revenues and the benefit of the Uber litigation settlement.\nStock-based compensation totaled $2.5 billion. The quarter-on-quarter step-up reflects the full-year equity refresh grant to employees at the beginning of the quarter and the biannual grant to SVPs.\nHeadcount at the end of the quarter was 85,050, up 4,940 people from last quarter, including just over 2,000 people who joined at the end of January when we closed our previously announced deal with HTC. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the additions from HTC, followed by hiring in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.\nOperating income was $7 billion, up 7% versus last year and the operating margin was 22%. Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes $3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investments recognized under the new accounting standard. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.\nOur effective tax rate was 11% for the first quarter. As outlined in our earnings press release, this includes a 5 percentage point reduction from the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which offset the income tax expense on the equity security gains.\n\n Net income was $9.4 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.33. As indicated in the table in our earnings press release, these results reflect an increase in net income of\n$2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share, due to the impacts from the gains on equity security investments we've already discussed.\nTurning now to capex and operating cash flow. Cash capex for the quarter was $7.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.6 billion with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $103 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenues were $31 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.\nNetwork revenues were $4.6 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other Revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 36% year-over-year fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play. As a reminder, the Hardware revenues in this line now include our Nest business and prior periods were restated.\nWe continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to impression-based monetization metrics for our Network business given the ongoing growth of programmatic.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $6.3 billion, or 24% of total advertising revenues, and up 36% year-over-year. This year-on-year increase in Sites TAC is a percentage of Sites revenues as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas -- namely mobile search and programmatic -- carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the Sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites. The increase in the Sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. The underlying trend affecting the Network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.4 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%.\nAccrued capex for the quarter was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment and data center construction. Facilities was the largest component of capex this quarter, due primarily to the $2.4 billion purchase of Chelsea Market that we announced in March.\n\n Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $150 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. As a reminder, Nest results are now reported as part of the Google segment, with revenues reflected in the Google Other Revenues line. Operating loss was $571 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued capex was $55 million.\nWe're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates: at Waymo, we have achieved 5 million miles of driving on city streets, adding the latest million in just 3 months. We also announced the long-term partnership with Jaguar Land Rover for their fully electric I-PACE vehicles.\nVerily is seeing good progress with Onduo, its joint venture with Sanofi. The company has made its diabetes management platform commercially available in three states with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Arkansas and South Carolina and Anthem's health plan in Georgia.\nLet me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues, the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth. We have both the business confidence to invest appropriately in the next phase of innovation as well as clarity about some very compelling opportunities that, in our judgment, will enable us to create shareholder value. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our revenue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on innovation, not only in our newer businesses like Cloud and Hardware, but in our Sites business. Specifically, we're excited by the still sizable opportunity in search advertising led by mobile. At 26% year-on-year revenue growth in our Sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance the user and advertiser experience.\nSecond, with respect to profitability. Within Cost of Revenues, the biggest component is TAC. While we expect Sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of Sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we continue to anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues will slow beginning in this second quarter.\nWithin opex, as I said last quarter, we are continuing to support our priority investment areas. Within R&D this is reflected in increased headcount, particularly for technical roles. Sales & Marketing is similarly elevated to support these areas, both in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect expenses to remain more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season.\nAs you've seen in prior quarters, G&A can be a more difficult line to forecast. In particular this quarter, we had the impact of the accrual for performance fees related to the equity gains previously discussed, partially offset by the reallocation of some expenses to Other Cost of Revenues and the Uber legal settlement.\n\n We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the proper intensity, while being diligent about long term plans and returns.\nFor our Other Bets, we remain focused on moving toward commercial applications in a number of areas, with a continued focus on calibrating investment to metrics for success.\nThird, with respect to capex. Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in capex investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities. Our facilities spend in Google, dominated by the Chelsea Market acquisition, reflects that we favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities.\nWith respect to compute capacity, the largest component of capex is for machines that incorporate the latest technologies. We are also investing in data center growth and increased network capacity through undersea cables. These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including Machine Learning,\nthe Assistant and Cloud. In many respects these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities, with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Ruth. The end of Q1 is always an exciting time as we prepare for our annual developer conference, Google I/O. Computing is evolving at a rapid rate and we can't wait to share what's next and how we are tackling important issues. I want to call out an important highlight from Q1 -- the Google News Initiative that we unveiled in March.\nOver the years we have worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages. We're building on that partnership with a $300 million investment to elevate and strengthen quality journalism. As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new products, including \"Subscribe with Google,\" developed in close collaboration with publishers -- which lets you use your Google account to buy a subscription on participating news sites. We've had overwhelming interest. Since the launch, we have heard from more than 300 news publishers who are interested in Subscribe with Google. We also introduced new tools for journalists and improvements to our platforms to ensure that we are surfacing accurate, quality content where it matters most.\nToday, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is help us advance that mission. Then I'll highlight progress in our three big areas -- Cloud, YouTube and Hardware -- and share updates on our computing and advertising platforms.\nFirst, machine learning and making information accessible to everyone. Our own ML-powered products like Google Photos and Google Lens gets better every day. The Google Assistant is a great example of this. In the home, we have added over 200 new device partners that work with the Assistant, just in the last four months alone. We now partner with all major manufacturers of connected devices for the home in the US. All told, the Google Assistant can\n\n now help you with over 1 million actions, including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the store or sending money to friends. Or if you want to get a ride-share home. For a concept we unveiled at I/O less than two years ago, this is great progress.\nAI is also unlocking new opportunities for everyone. Just in the last few months, we've seen some amazing applications -- from dairy farmers in Georgia using TensorFlow to improve the health of their herds, to our own Google researchers who figured out how to use ML techniques to assess a person's risk of a heart attack. The possibilities of AI in healthcare are truly exciting.\nAt a recent TensorFlow Summit, we introduced TensorFlow Hub, making it easier for developers to share and reuse models, so that we can work together to tackle even more problems and get to better ideas faster. Our investments in this area are helped because of our specialized Tensor Processing Units, which are specifically designed to be highly efficient for machine learning applications.\nOf course, we continue to advance Google's core mission in other ways, too. We recently launched our Google Go app in 26 African countries. This app reduces the amount of data needed to display search results by 40%. And we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over their information across all our products. Every single day nearly 20 million people visit My Account, which gives them options to review their Google security, privacy and ad settings. Additionally tools like Security Checkup and Privacy Checkup prompt people to keep their accounts secure and control their data settings.\nNow turning to our three big areas, Cloud, YouTube and Hardware. Last quarter we shared some exciting metrics about the progress of Google Cloud, including that we passed a billion dollars per quarter in 2017. In Q1 we saw increasing momentum. We are growing across the board, and are also signing significantly larger, more strategic deals for Cloud. Our security capabilities, the easy-to-use advanced data analytics and machine learning solutions and the secure and industry leading collaboration platform G Suite are winning customers over. Google Cloud is growing well.\nSome examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning expertise to build complex neural nets, and more than 20 new security products. Our global infrastructure continues to expand to support demand. We commissioned three new subsea cables and announced new regions in Canada, Japan, Netherlands and Saudi Arabia, bringing our total of recently launched and upcoming regions to 20.\nG Suite has reached a point where it can serve all the needs of a large enterprise and, as a result, the growth has hit an inflection point. The suite is going from strength to strength. We believe our secure environment is an important factor in driving enterprise customer wins. G Suite customers like Colgate-Palmolive Company tell us that no one offers a better combination of hardware, network and data security.\n\n In Q1, we also signed agreements with customers like Airbus and Thailand's Krungthai Bank. As a result, G Suite revenue growth accelerated in Q1.\nNext, YouTube. The platform continues to grow as millions of creators build communities and find opportunity on YouTube. Over the last year, channels earning six figures annually grew more than 40%. This quarter, Dua Lipa's video for \"New Rules\" became the 100th video on YouTube to reach one billion views. We're also investing in new experiences like live content, where we see tremendous momentum. One recent example was our exclusive Coachella Livestream which had more than 41 million live views from all over the world. Coachella was YouTube's most viewed live music festival -- ever. And, no surprise, Beyonce was the most viewed Coachella performance ever on YouTube.\nEven as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on making sure that YouTube remains a safe platform with great content. We are aggressively combating content that violates our strict policies, through a combination of user and machine flags. Over 6 million videos removed in Q4 were first flagged by our machine systems, and over 75% of those videos were removed before receiving a single view. We also changed our monetization requirements to better identify creators who contribute positively to the community, and drive more ad revenue to them.\nMoving to Hardware. This quarter we welcome Nest to the Google Hardware team to supercharge our efforts. Nest is building industry-leading products for the home, including new additions like the Nest Hello doorbell and Nest Temperature Sensor. In 2017, they sold more devices than the previous two years combined. They are an incredibly talented team with fantastic momentum. Google Home continues to be super popular, and we are making it available in many more countries. Just recently, we launched Google Home and Mini in India and Singapore, and the response has been terrific. Our early 2018 Net Promoter Scores rank among the highest in the industry across all product categories. This shows how much love people have for \"Made by Google,\" consumer hardware devices, and makes us even more excited for what's ahead.\nThere's great momentum across our computing platforms like Android and Chrome. At Mobile World Congress, a new generation of Android partner devices was introduced, including Android One phones like the Nokia 7 Plus. Android One pairs high quality hardware with a secure and streamlined software experience from Google. This quarter, we launched the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, the first Chrome OS tablet designed specifically for education. It is a secure and easily shareable tablet, equipped with all the Chromebook features that educators and students love.\nAnd finally, our advertising platforms. We continue to make Google Search and Shopping the best places for people to find and buy products from a range of merchants. We recently announced Shopping Actions, allowing customers to easily buy from their choice of participating retailers on the Google Assistant and Search with a universal cart -- across mobile, desktop, and even Google Home. The results are really helping retailers. Early testing showed that participating retailers see an average increase in basket size of about 30%.\n\n YouTube is delivering great results for advertisers. To help brands reach broad audiences on YouTube with even more flexibility, we introduced TrueView for Reach which optimizes in-stream ads to reach a wide audience. In beta testing, 9 out of 10 campaigns drove a significant lift in Ad Recall with an average lift of nearly 20%. We're also helping small businesses take advantage of video with the expansion of YouTube Director Onsite to over 170 US cities. This gives SMBs access to a professional filmmaker to create and edit their video ads.\nFinally, we remain focused on investing in our publisher partners. Last year, we paid\n$12.6 billion to publishing partners in our ad network. We recently announced AdSense Auto ads. This uses machine learning to analyze ad placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they're likely to perform well while providing a good user experience.\nGoogle's success depends not just on the success of our partners, but also on the communities where we work. We recently announced a Rolling Study Halls program for rural areas across 12 states. It equips school buses with Wi-Fi, devices and on-board educators so that students with long commutes can get their homework done during the trip. We're also making long-term investments in our offices and data centers around the country. Last month, we announced the purchase of Manhattan's Chelsea Market building. And in Tennessee and Alabama, we broke ground on two new data centers, which will have a big economic impact on the local economies. These investments are made hand-in-hand with our commitment to sustainability. In 2017, we officially met our goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all the electricity consumed by our operations around the world.\nI want to close by saying thank you to our employees. It's been a particularly tough few weeks for the Google family, especially at YouTube. I'm so proud of the resilience that our employees have shown and I\u2019m so grateful for the support we've gotten across the industry and from the community. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star and the number 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered, or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. Once again, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star 1. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nDouglas Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, just first on the accounting change, I was just hoping you could clarify, if we're trying to normalize that, is it right that we would be adding back about $632 million to operating income and then reducing EPS by $3.40, and then just on the EPS side perhaps adjusting for the tax rate? And then, just in terms of the business, I just wanted to ask about Waymo. If you could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in Phoenix and how quickly you\u2019d look to expand to other markets. And then just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services. Thanks.\n\n Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Sure. So on the accounting standard, we tried to lay out all the component parts clearly on the cover of the earnings release so that you would have it all in one place. I think you summarized it right, but I\u2019d just direct everybody to the earnings release, you know, the net of which was the gain from the equity investments was $2.4 billion to net income, that is net of performance fees as well as the release of a deferred tax asset that we have. So it does reflect $3 billion in gains. I think you know this, but this quarter the accounting standard requires marks for everything where there's an observable raise, so these are unrealized -- the majority of them are unrealized, not actually monetized by Alphabet. And then the performance fees are calculated based on investment returns. They're accrued, but not paid, until an exit event occurs and they do appear in Opex. And as you noted, there's also, therefore, the benefit that flows through on the tax line and that is 5 percentage points of benefit offset to the effective tax rate for the quarter.\nAs it relates to your Waymo question, I think there was a lot in there. We do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts. It is still very early. In terms of our progress, this year is about offering a service that is safe, that works, that delights users in the Phoenix area. The rider program in Phoenix is open to members of the public and riders will use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel and will pay for the service. We've also had progress on the vehicle partnerships. As I mentioned in my opening comments, last month Waymo announced it signed a long-term strategic partnership with Jaguar beginning with the collaboration to design and manufacture self-driving I-PACE vehicles for Waymo's transportation service.\nThese are all electric cars. This new partnership in the vehicles adds to our strong position with FCA, and the production of the cars begins in 2020. And then we are expanding our testing to more states. We're also working on additional areas like applying the technology to logistics and deliveries and working with cities to help strengthen public transportation and for personal use vehicles. And, you know, as we\u2019ve talked about on a bunch of calls, the opportunity is here for us because we started with safety and we remain a leader in safety, and we do believe that's the foundation for success. And it builds on the -- all the test miles that we've done. So, you know, we keep coming back to, when you create vehicles that drive themselves safely, we think there's a lot of potential uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on.\nDouglas Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thank you, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great, thank you. I wanted to ask two quick questions. One, just one on GDPR and then one on Cloud. On GDPR, I was just wondering if you could share with us, kind of, any impact you're thinking about as the implementation occurs later in May. And so any thoughts you could share there would be great. And then on Cloud, Sundar, you had mentioned you're seeing a lot of momentum. You said G Suite, I believe, accelerated in Q1. I was wondering if there was any color on the GCP side that you could share from a growth perspective, if that business accelerated or not and, you know, kind of how were the deal sizes trending for that business in particular. Thank you.\n\n Sundar Pichai, CEO Google: Great. Maybe I'll do the GDPR first. GDPR, you know, I realize is a fairly new public topic, but for us, it's not new. You know, we started working on GDPR compliance over 18 months ago. And have been very, very engaged on it. It's really important, and we care about getting it right. And overall, we've long had a very robust and strong privacy program at Google, too. So we are committed to meeting requirements on May 25th and also long term. We are working very closely with advertisers, publishers, and our partners. And, you know, we'll also update all the privacy policies and controls we provide to users worldwide.\nSo it's a big effort. We are very committed to it. You know, we are very focused on getting it right by our users and partners. And that's where our focus is now.\nOn -- Heather -- on Cloud, I guess your question was about overall growth. And, you know, we are continuing, the momentum has been very strong on Cloud as well. You know, we haven't talked about G Suite much, and so we highlighted the momentum there. But Cloud is continuing its great growth. We are seeing it across the board. Things that I would call out is we're seeing larger deals as well. We are seeing good synergies between G Suite and Cloud. The areas where we have done acquisitions like Apigee, they are beginning to work in terms of driving synergies to Cloud. And, you know, and the efforts we are beginning to put -- put together with our partners, you know, that is beginning to bear fruit as well. So we have Go-to-Market programs now with SAP, Cisco and Salesforce, and I think we are beginning to see early results from that and, you know, and hopefully that translates into more momentum going forward.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.\nYour line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe two for Sundar, if I can. One, on mobile search, continue to call that out as a point of strength in the results. What are you most excited about in terms of either product innovation or the ability to get consumers to adopt mobile search more broadly on devices globally which could lead to more ad budgets moving into mobile search. And then on Hardware, you've now been through two years of sort of Pixel devices. You've made the acqui-hire of the HTC engineers. Can you give us a sense of what you've learned so far from your Hardware efforts and how that might evolve product innovation or go-to-market strategies long-term. Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On mobile search, for me, you know, mobile obviously raises the bar, and if you look at the evolution of Search, you know, we evolved to stay ahead of user expectations, and we evolved from just providing links to answers. I just feel at a high level the next big evolution we are doing as part of mobile search and Assistant is to actually help users complete actions, to help get things done. And, you know, that's really hard to do at scale, and that's the work we are doing. And as we do that, you know, it will impact just -- not just Assistant but mobile search more broadly. And obviously there is a commercial impact as well.\n\n So we continue to be very excited about the opportunities there.\nOn Hardware, you know, the exciting part for us is, you know, now, I think we have all the end-to-end capabilities of a world class, you know, hardware organization along with the quality of the software organizations we've always had. And in this area, it truly takes long-term planning. And so, for example, if you think about silicon, et cetera, the longer you can do it, the more advantages you have. And so, you know, I definitely feel we are taking the steps towards being able to do this well for the long-term. Part of that, obviously, involves scaling up our go-to-market strategies, both in the US and internationally, so that we can drive -- drive adoption. You know, I said earlier, our Net Promoter Scores show that we are right up there with the best in class devices, and across all the products we have. Not just our Pixel, across our Nest family and everything we do. So the opportunity is clearly there. We're going to lean into it. And, you know, it takes 2 to 3 years to really get to the scale where we want to see it, but we're committed to getting there.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks so much.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC Capital Markets): Great. Thanks. I want to follow up on Heather's question on GDPR. And the question I want to ask is, I understand that you're -- you know, been working for a long time to make sure that you're compliant, but do you think that GDPR or other regulation that you see on the horizon is likely to impact materially the targeting capabilities that advertisers have on Google? Is there something in the regulation that's going to make Google and its properties less attractive to advertisers? That's the action question I want to ask. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Mark. You know, above everything else as we are working through GDPR we are making sure we are focused on getting that user experience right for our users and our partners. But to clarify your question further, you know, first of all, it's important to understand that most of our ad business is Search, where we rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show a relevant ad or product. And so, you know, we've been preparing this for 18 months and I think -- I think, you know, we have focused on getting the compliance right. It will be a years\u2019 long effort and, you know, we are helping not just us, but our publishers and partners. But overall, we think we'll be able to do all that, you know, with a positive impact for users and publishers and advertisers, and so our business.\nMark Mahaney (RBC Capital Markets): Okay. Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on desktop search. It's always nice to hear that your oldest business is still growing. Just curious,\n\n could you give one or two tangible examples of products that are still driving the desktop search growth? And Sundar, I understand you're always focused on user experience. At a high level, what do you see as the biggest areas for potential further improvement in desktop search? And let me ask you the same question about YouTube. What are sort of the biggest areas of tension that you're focused on improving from a user perspective on YouTube right now?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: So, on, you know, on desktop search -- sorry, your question on the user experience on desktop search, how do we see improvements? You know, look, I mean, the same -- first of all, users are having cross device experiences, cross screen experiences, right? So I think your desktop search experience, mobile search, everything goes hand-in-hand. And every -- you know, all the work we are doing to make mobile search better translates to desktop search as well. Areas where desktop search historically has been a bit behind is in terms of things like identity and payments and having all that work well to enhance the user experience. And with Chrome now, we're investing a lot in those areas as well, and I think that will contribute overall to improvements there.\nOn YouTube, you know, there are many, many areas we are focused on YouTube, you know. They're always very focused on making sure they are supporting emerging formats, be it mobile livestreaming or emerging formats like VR. And so that's an area of focus for us. We\u2019re also are really looking at what are all the new monetization options for creators beyond advertising. So be it subscriptions, features like Super Chat which we have launched are very popular. We are beta testing sponsorships, merchandise, merchandising and concert ticketing, et cetera. So these are all areas by which we are improving. And obviously there are additional areas like music and YouTube TV which are seeing great momentum as well.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.\nYour line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Great. Just two questions, please. Americas revenue accelerated nicely on a currency neutral basis, this is a geography that rarely comes up on these calls. So any color about what's driving that acceleration and the sustainability of what's going on in the Americas region? And then Ruth, a question on Sites TAC. So I know you said the pace of de-leverage is going to start to improve next quarter. Is this something that we should expect to happen for a year and then kind of normalize back to a pretty steady pace of de-leverage? Or is this -- are we over some critical threshold and we should, you know, see this trend of moderating de-leverage continue for several years into the future? Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So on your first question, Other Americas, you know, I would say like the other regions, really pleased with the strength we have across the regions. This is obviously one of the smaller ones, so growing at a slightly faster clip and really pleased with the broad strength there. It starts with the Sites revenues strength, but on top of that, they benefited from Hardware devices launching in some additional markets over the past year.\n\n And then in terms of TAC, you know, I would say there's not much to add to what we've already said. After some kind of sustained period of stronger increases, we were pleased last quarter to be able to signal that this quarter that pace of change is slowing and, you know, I'll just leave it at that for now.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): Great, thank you for taking my questions. I have two. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, on capex, even if we exclude the Chelsea Market one-timer, the growth in capex is really substantial, even on a kind of recurring basis. Should we expect that sort of dramatic growth or step up in the growth of rate and ongoing capex to continue throughout the year or, you know, other than the Chelsea Market one-timer, were there any -- is there any reason to think that it was timing, in terms of the timing, front-end weighted into the first quarter for capex? And then secondly on Sundar, just a question on YouTube and your media strategy at a higher level. In view of the success of other competitive subscription TV products out there, Internet video products, can you just talk about YouTube Red and any thoughts on ways you can accelerate growth for your YouTube subscription video products, whether that may be organic investment in content original production or even via acquisition? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of capex, you know, it's about equally split between facilities and our technical infrastructure, and as you know, we had the -- the $2.4 billion purchase in New York as well as this continued ground-up development projects. Facilities does tend to be lumpier over time. We are continuing with the ground-up development projects and, you know, as a reminder, we do favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities, and that has served us well over the years.\nBut I think more to your question, with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute power to support growth that we see across Google and the largest component is on machines. It's also on data centers and undersea cables. And on machines, the biggest contributor is the demand that we're seeing. So, in particular, it's the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet, plus the requirements for Cloud and Search and YouTube and then secondarily the increased cost of newer technologies, you know, CPUs, memory, network. So I think really to answer your question most directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to suggest, you know, a one-off in terms of the investments we're making in technical infrastructure.\nAnd then in terms of the data centers, we are investing globally. We currently have over 20 sites on 4 continents, and that's under differing stages of construction. As Sundar noted, you know, it's across the US, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa, so we're really building out to support the growth that we're seeing.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): Thank you.\n\n Candice (Operator): Thank you, and our next --\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Sorry. On the second question, on YouTube, you know, for sure, you know, that adoption and feedback across both YouTube Red and YouTube Music has been great to see. We are doing a lot more work there. You will see us continue to invest further, and develop those offerings better, and as part of that, you know, further drive adoption. So, for example, YouTube Originals end up playing a big part in YouTube Red subscriptions, and so far we've launched in a handful of markets and we'll continue to roll it out to more markets there. And on YouTube Music, you know, we are working on enhancing the product, and I think there's definitely great opportunities there as well.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): Okay. Thank you very much.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Hi, good afternoon everyone. Sundar, I had two for you. First, during the quarter there were some reports of changes in leadership at your Search and AI divisions functionally sounds like separating leadership over those two very large important businesses for the company. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how that may impact broader strategy for the company?\nAnd then second, a little bit more tactical one on your advertising business you launched Shopping Actions during the quarter with a pay per sale model, pricing model. And I was just curious to hear what type of feedback you were getting from advertisers that led to a product with that pricing model in particular any other features of Shopping Actions that you think are important to highlight.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Dan. On -- you know, we obviously -- you know, Search has been leading the company in terms of how they have been adopting machine learning and AI and it's really working well through Search and Assistant. We sense that, you know, obviously as an AI first company, AI cuts across everything we do in Google and so as an organization it's a horizontal organization which needs to serve all our areas, and in some ways the change reflects that. And, you know, we have very capable leaders. Jeff who runs -- you know, was the founder of Google Brain and, you know, really well positioned to lead our AI efforts. And Ben has been at Google since the early days of Search, started in Google in 2000 and has been driving Search for over 18 years. And so we are very excited, and we think the changes will serve the company well.\nOn your second thing, the question was on Shopping Actions?\nDan Salmon (BMO): And in particular the price per sale pricing model.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, so I think we -- you know, we announced this new service in March, and the feedback has been very positive. I mentioned earlier, which is, you\n\n know, for retailers when they are testing this, they see it drives in increase in basket size, so that means users are interacting with the product well and, you know, that's all I have to share for now. It's still early days.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Okay, great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert\nBaird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Great. Thanks. A couple for me, please. First, on the Cloud business, I was wondered if you could provide any color, at least on the relative momentum you're seeing in that segment from infrastructure services compared to platform or software services. And then related to the adoption of AMP, I guess a key question we get asked is, whether that ultimately changes usage, and maybe you have some perspective on this from Android, but in the ecosystem between mobile web pages and app usage, if you're seeing any shift among users between those formats. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on the first question of Cloud, you know, look, I mean, you know, I think the main thing I would say is, you know, the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud, you know, based on what we hear back from customers is, you know, our advantage in data analytics and machine learning. The fact that we really support an open, agile, developer environment. Kubernetes has literally become the standard for workloads, and the fact that we are open in terms of how we approach the space. Security is becoming a big differentiator for us and, you know, something we've been leading for a while, and I think that's driving it. G Suite, as I called out earlier, you know, is a good synergistic driver. You know, G Suite is doing well and clearly a very unique offering, and it's gotten very comprehensive, and so I think overall it comes together well.\nOn your second question around AMP, you know, AMP has been, you know, definitely very successful. It's really made publisher content much more friendly for users in terms of latency and the user experience, and hence, you know, that adoption has been great. For sure AMP is definitely helped the mobile web, and that's one part of the big reasons we did it. You know, mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news. And so, you know, us investing there clearly, clearly makes a difference. I guess, you know, for example, when we look at, I don't know, J.Crew adopted AMP. Their mobile page loading times are now over 90% faster and now they are integrating the Google Payment Request API, that reduces checkout times from 2 minutes to 30 seconds or so. So things like that, you know, we're going to constantly stay on improving the mobile web, and that plays a big part in how our ecosystem works.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\n Michael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thank you. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. First for Sundar. Can you give us any sense of how Google Home consumers are using Search on these devices differently than maybe the traditional ways of Search? Are you finding in those homes, is it additive to the overall search activity? And then for Ruth, when you look at the last page of the press release where you've shown the new monetization metrics. You see a real increase in the cost per impression on Network sites. So can you talk about maybe what's happening there? Is there a mix shift, types of publishers, types of products, or is that just market inflation? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Look, for sure, you know, Google Home gives rise to a lot of new and unique use cases. You know, Actions are a big part of it. You know, call Mom is a good example of something you say to Google Home a lot, like, which is different than what you would say to Search. We see this as, you know, a good complementary thing. You know, you will see Search embrace some of the capabilities you find in Google Assistant and Google Home and vice versa. And so overall, I view this as additive in the long term, and we're definitely just getting started there.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then on the Network monetization trends, first just to give people a bit more color, when we launched the AdSense businesses our Network revenues were largely click-based, and over time there's been a meaningful mix change in our business, given the strong growth in programmatic which is impression-based. So, as a result, this shift now covers more of the business. And then in terms of the question on impression growth versus CPM growth, you know, as we've discussed on prior calls, the Network business is actually a number of different businesses and then within that we had flat year-on-year growth in the number of impressions that was driven by efforts to improve user experience through a reduction of less relevant ads in AFC. And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs. And then the trend in impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user, publisher and advertiser but it really goes to the efforts that we make.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thanks, Ruth. Thanks, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Good afternoon. Just as a question regarding any changes on your framework for growth versus operating margins. The last few quarters you've seen steady top-line acceleration, yet the margins were down. Can you just talk about how you think about it at a high level for this year, any changes from the past?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Yeah, it's an important question. As we\u2019ve talked about on many, many calls, we have been, and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth. And we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary. And as I said in opening comments, just given our confidence as we're looking forward, we want to make sure we're investing appropriately in the next phase of innovation and we have\n\n clarity about some very compelling opportunities. And in our judgment, that enables us to maximize shareholder value. So we're taking the steps really to put in place the support for long-term -- you know, longer-term growth.\nPart of what I'm saying you can see in our Sites revenue growth, tried to make that clear in opening comments, we see this consistent strong momentum globally and we're really excited about the still sizable opportunity led by mobile search and we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience and thereby extend the growth in our ads business. You can see this also in the trend on capex spend, as I noted in our opening comments. The investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook. And that's supporting, you know, the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant, and then we also see extraordinary upside in the newer markets, as Sundar has talked about most notably cloud computing and hardware. And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there. And then finally, when we look at the market opportunity in both self-driving cars and life sciences, our judgment is it makes sense to place the kind of investments that we are. And with all of this, you know, what also hasn't changed is we appreciate the importance of prioritization and picking our spots, and we're keenly focused on steps we can take to both make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. So at a high level, the approach hasn't changed. You're seeing the investments here.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of\nCredit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Okay, thank you. So, you know, Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's ad products to be perhaps overwhelming. So, you know, can you talk about the rate of uptake among the smaller advertisers and whether or not this is helping to catalyze growth in new budgets and where these guys might otherwise have not been able to advertise before. There's SMBs and then there's local also. So what will be the plan to get this technology into the hands of folks who will want to use them? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: This is a big focus for us and, you know, today SMBs are -- you know, play a big role in our ecosystem and, you know, we are doing a lot of stuff to support them, across the board. Right? And from -- you know, from things like our offerings to help SMBs get an online presence, create a website, be discovered in local search and Google Maps. So, you know, we do a lot of detailed work to make sure SMBs are working well. We are also doing a lot of stuff on local -- local as well, including efforts even around local services. So we have very specific initiatives.\nThis is going to be -- I mean, it's actually -- to us it's bread and butter of what we do here, and so there's a lot of effort underway. Not to mention the fact that we provide G Suite for\n\n businesses as they scale up as well. So it's an end to end offering, and you'll continue to see us invest more here.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you, and that concludes our question-and-answer session for\ntoday. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.", "20182": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the \u200bQ2 2018 Earnings Call webcast\u200b.\nAlphabet Q2 2018 Earnings Call July 23, 2018\nCandice (Operator): \u200bGood day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet second quarter 2018 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star and then zero on your touch-tone telephone. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference call over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: \u200bThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.\nNow I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Thank you, Ellen. We delivered another quarter with strong operating performance, reflecting our focus on building great experiences for users, advertisers, and enterprise customers around the world.\nIn aggregate, we had substantial revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year, and up 23% in constant currency. Sites revenues continued to exhibit strong year-on-year momentum, benefiting from innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Our Network advertising business maintained healthy growth led by AdMob and programmatic advertising. The businesses comprising Other Revenues, namely Cloud, Play, and Hardware, again had substantial growth.\nOur outline for today\u2019s call is: I\u2019ll begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. There are two items to note in our earnings press release. First, we provided a table to highlight the impact of the European Commission fines on Operating Income, Net Income and EPS results in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017. Second, as discussed last quarter, our results are affected by the new accounting\n\n standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility in OI&E. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.\nStarting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $32.7 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $768 million, or $665 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions: U.S. revenues were $14.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%, reflecting strengthening of both the Euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $5.1 billion, up 36% versus last year, and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Korean won. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 31% year-over-year, and up 34% in constant currency reflecting strengthening of the dollar relative to the Brazilian Real.\nOn a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.9 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other Cost of Revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were: costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continued to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses; and content-acquisition costs - primarily for YouTube; followed by hardware-related costs.\nOperating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $16.0 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating expenses were $10.9 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in Sales and Marketing expenses reflects increases in Sales and Marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud, followed by advertising investments in Cloud and the Assistant. G&A expense trends in the second quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A primarily to Other Cost of Revenues.\nStock-based compensation totalled $2.4 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 89,058, up 4,008 from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.\nOperating income was $2.8 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating income was $7.9 billion, up 15% versus last year, for an operating margin of 24%.\nOther Income and Expense was $1.4 billion, which includes $1.1 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 24.2% for the second quarter, reflecting a sizable impact from the non-deductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $3.2 billion and earnings per\n\n diluted share were $4.54. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.75.\nTurning now to capex and operating cash flow. Cash capex for the quarter was $5.5 billion, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $10.1 billion with free cash flow of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results.\nStarting with the Google segment. Revenues were $32.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $23.3 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with strong contributions from both YouTube and desktop search\u200b. \u200bNetwork revenues were $4.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 37% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play and Hardware\u200b.\nWe continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $6.4 billion, or 23% of total advertising revenues, and up 26% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in the Sites TAC rate, which was offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites. The increase in the Sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in the Network TAC rate as the result of a favorable mix shift within our programmatic business.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totalled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.0 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27.6%. Accrued capex for the quarter was $5.3 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities.\nLet me now turn and talk about Other Bets. Other Bets revenues were $145 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $732 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued capex was $10 million.\nWe\u2019re pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates: Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler, with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And last week, Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles, with most of those on city streets. A couple of weeks ago, X announced that Loon and Wing have graduated to become independent companies under Alphabet. Graduation from X signals that these companies have reached certain technical and business milestones and that their focus is shifting toward commercialization. And just last week, Loon indicated that it is partnering with Telkom Kenya to launch commercial service in regions of Kenya by early 2019.\n\n Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook.\nFirst, with respect to Revenues. We\u2019re pleased with the ongoing momentum in our advertising businesses. As discussed previously, we continue to identify new opportunities through innovation, including the benefits of applying machine learning to create more useful experiences for users and advertisers. Looking ahead, our hardware business is seasonal, typically experiencing lower growth in the third quarter in anticipation of the launch of new products for the holiday season.\nSecond, with respect to profitability. Within Cost of Revenues, the biggest component is TAC. As we\u2019ve discussed for the past couple of quarters, we expected the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites Revenue would slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that clearly in our results this quarter. As frequently discussed, \u200bwe do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, albeit at a more moderate pace relative to the year-on-year increases experienced over the past several quarters.\nWithin Opex, we continue to take a disciplined approach to setting priorities as we invest for long term growth. The majority of our headcount growth continues to be in technical roles in engineering and product management. In terms of business areas, the largest number of headcount additions were in our Cloud business, with hires for engineering, sales and marketing. As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates. As I mentioned last quarter, regarding Sales and Marketing, we continue to expect expenses to be more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season. Another factor to consider in year-on-year comparisons next quarter is the timing of two expense items in Q3 last year. As we called out last year, there was a meaningful benefit in the third quarter of 2017 from the shift in timing of our annual equity refresh and also from the timing of Sales and Marketing spend, which was more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.\nFor our Other Bets, we remain focused on making progress on a number of commercial opportunities across the businesses, while continuing to manage investment against achievement of key milestones.\nThird, with respect to Capex. As I discussed with you last quarter, our commitment to growth is evident in the ongoing trend in capex investment. We\u2019ve been investing meaningfully in Search and Ads, consistent with the opportunities we see to benefit the user and advertiser experience. And we are investing in the additional compute power required to support growth in the number of YouTube users globally. We\u2019re also investing in new businesses that are growing at a rapid pace and have sizable compute needs, most notably Cloud. The investment pace also reflects the importance of machine learning across all of our products, including Search and Ads. Although machine learning is more compute intensive, it is increasingly core to businesses across Alphabet and opens up the possibility of accelerated innovation in products and services. In keeping with our approach across Alphabet to invest thoughtfully for long term value creation, we remain focused on both performance and cost effectiveness.\nI will now turn the call over to Sundar.\n\n Sundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Thanks, Ruth. It\u2019s been a busy few months at Google, and we showed a lot of what we are working on at events like Google Marketing Live, Brandcast and of course, our annual developer conference Google I/O. It was exciting to have millions of people join us, in person and via livestream.\nTomorrow I hope you\u2019ll tune in to Google Cloud Next, where the great momentum and innovation in our Cloud business will be fully on display.\nThe common thread you\u2019ll hear on today\u2019s call is the benefit of machine learning and AI - and how it\u2019s improving our products and generating great results for our users and partners.\nI also hope that everyone enjoyed the World Cup as much as I did; I know our French Googlers were very excited! I loved the competition, and was extremely proud to see positive feedback about how useful Google Translate was for people who travelled to Russia. The app translates about 143 billion words a day, and during the World Cup, we saw a huge bump in volume. In these simple moments -- when you\u2019re in an unfamiliar place or you don\u2019t know the language -- Google is there to help, with the right information at the right time. This is what we aspire to be best at and it\u2019s why billions of people continue to put their trust in our products.\nToday, I\u2019ll start with how AI is enabling us to advance our mission of making information accessible and useful to everyone in new ways. Then I\u2019ll share updates on our computing, video and advertising platforms, which are helping our partners succeed and grow. And finally, I\u2019ll talk about our growing Cloud business.\nLet\u2019s begin with AI helping our mission.\nWe revamped the Google News app in May to great reviews. It uses machine learning to highlight top stories organized for users, explore topics more deeply, with articles from a range of trusted news sources. We believe in the need to deliver high quality information and news to users, and to support the news industry as we do so.\nThe Google Assistant is another great product based on machine learning. By the end of this year, it will be available in more than 30 languages and 80 countries. We\u2019ve worked with partners to expand the number of smart devices that are now compatible with the Google Assistant, like doorbells, dryers, refrigerators, and more and connect with more than 5,000 devices in the home.\nAt Google I/O, we also highlighted how AI is improving Google Maps -- including enhancing the experience with Assistant and AR features. Through our improvements in machine learning, \u200bwe have seen a 25x increase in our ability to build maps algorithmically and we have added 110 million algorithmically drawn buildings to Maps since the beginning of this year\u200b. And with over a billion users, we\u2019re continuing to see tremendous growth in Maps - \u200bwith especially strong growth in countries like Indonesia, India, and Nigeria, each of which are growing over 50% year-on-year.\n\n There are many more great AI-powered features we rolled out this quarter including: the new version of Gmail with Smart Compose, a new feature that helps users draft emails faster.\u200b \u200bAnd Google Photos now suggests actions to help you brighten, share, rotate or archive a picture.\nNext, our computing, video and advertising platforms. These platforms are providing real economic opportunities for developers, creators and publishers in every corner of the world. Last year, I announced that in the three year period from 2014 to 2016, we paid out over $15 billion in revenue to our creator, publisher and app developer partners in Europe, Middle East and Africa via AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. Our contribution is accelerating. In 2017 alone, we generated an additional $7 billion for these partners.\nFirst, our computing platforms. Ten years ago, we launched the first Android phone with a simple idea: to build a mobile platform that\u2019s free and open to everyone. Today, there are more than 24,000 devices, at every price point, from more than 1,300 different brands. The Android ecosystem supports thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices; millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses with Android; and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones. This is all supported by a business model that encourages and enables this open ecosystem to thrive.\nContinuing this momentum, at I/O we unveiled a plethora of new features throughout the Android platform, like battery-saving features in Android P, new Google Assistant capabilities on Wear OS, a new Android model to help developers optimize for a variety of devices and form factors, as well as tools to help users understand and control how they are spending time on their device.\nOur investments in our computing platforms, as well as in AI and design, are also helping us generate great momentum in our Made by Google hardware business - across Pixel, Home, Nest, Chromecast and more:\nWe brought Google Home and Mini to Ireland, Austria (sic) [Australia], Spain and Mexico. Additionally, bringing the Nest and Google teams together is showing early results -- the products can more seamlessly work together, and our product development and go-to-market are benefiting from the new alignment. There\u2019s a lot more to come here in the next few months.\nSecond, our video platform YouTube, is growing tremendously. We launched a revamped YouTube Music Service across 17 countries, and it\u2019s receiving great feedback -- from users and artists alike.\nThis quarter, YouTube rebranded its subscription service, YouTube Premium, featuring Originals like our hit series Cobra Kai, which got 41 million views of the first episode alone.\nWhile advertising on YouTube is an incredibly strong and growing source of income for creators, we\u2019re also investing in new ways for creators to generate revenue on the platform, including: paid channel memberships; merchandise shelves on YouTube channels; and endorsement opportunities, through a company we acquired in 2016, Famebit. In fact, half of the creators that used Famebit in the first three months of 2018 doubled their YouTube revenue.\n\n And third, our advertising platforms, which are firing on all cylinders, as we put the power of machine learning into marketers\u2019 hands. At Google Marketing Live, we introduced our newly rebranded advertising products: our core product, Google Ads; Google Marketing Platform, which provides analytics and ad serving for large marketers and agencies; and Google Ad Manager, our monetization engine for publishers.\nWe also announced a new ad format powered by machine learning, called Responsive Search Ads. It automates the manual process of building text ads and optimizes them in real time to show the best-performing ad for each search query.\nAdvertisers also got a first look at Local Campaigns and Smart Campaigns. Local Campaigns are designed exclusively to drive foot traffic to local businesses. And Smart Campaigns are now the default for new SMB advertisers. Small business owners love the simplicity and the results.\nThis quarter, we announced shopping and commerce partnerships with leading global retailers like Carrefour designed to give people the power to shop wherever and however they want. Carrefour is a great example of how we can partner deeply with companies, bringing our shopping and ads and Cloud products together for them. They recently chose to migrate from Office to G Suite for their more than 160,000 employees and have selected us as their main Cloud provider, based on our ability to support the company\u2019s digital transformation.\nSpeaking of our efforts to help businesses succeed in the cloud. Our Cloud business has great momentum. It\u2019s a natural extension of our long-time strengths in computing, data centers and machine learning. We have developed these over many years and they power our own services in the cloud, and are now helping others. This week\u2019s Google Cloud Next event will have more than 20,000 attendees, up from over 2,000 at our cloud conference in 2016, with \u200bover 250 customers speaking\u200b.\nI won\u2019t spoil any of the surprises, but I do want to call out Google Cloud\u2019s momentum. Success of our vertical strategy and customer centric-approach was illustrated by key wins, including Domino\u2019s Pizza, SoundCloud and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Target is migrating key areas of its business to Google Cloud Platform. Financial institutions are increasingly turning to the cloud to modernize their systems, explore new business models, and improve customer experiences. New customers include Banco Itau in Brazil. We also have a rapidly growing business for our specialized Cloud AI services. AirAsia expanded its relationship with us to use machine learning and data analytics.\nWe\u2019re seeing an acceleration in business adoption of Chromebooks, the most secure and cost-efficient way for businesses to enable their employees to work in the cloud. \u200bIn \u200bQ2, unit sales of managed Chromebooks grew by more than 175% year-over-year. \u200b And we saw deployments at customers like Veolia.\nAnd to support our growing global customer base, we continued to invest in new cables, opened new regions in Finland and Los Angeles, and announced the Zurich region. We now have 17 open regions, with three more on the way.\n\n Before I close, I want to give a quick shout out to the work that we are doing to build great specialized products for the next wave of people coming online for the first time in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Nigeria -- many of whom experience the Web only through their mobile phone. This is a big area of focus for us. Through a great partnership with Indian Railways and RailTel, we\u2019ve hit our goal of enabling high speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India. We\u2019ve also rolled out this Google Station model in Indonesia and Mexico, with more to come soon. And to help spur AI innovation in Africa, we recently announced a new Google AI research center in Ghana, with the goal of bringing together top machine learning researchers and engineers to explore AI research and applications in Africa and beyond.\nOf course, our commitment to help communities and people benefit from the digital economy extends beyond the products that they use. Last month, as part of our broader Grow with Google effort, we expanded the Google IT Support Professional Certificate program to more than 25 community colleges in the US. This will give students an opportunity to learn skills needed to jumpstart their careers in IT Support.\nI want to thank Googlers for their hard work, which helps us create products that billions of people love and use every day. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bThank you Sundar, and we will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you, ladies and gentlemen, on the phone lines. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star and then the number one key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): \u200bThank you very much. Two questions, if I can. Sundar, for you, following up on your comments, we've seen all of these partnerships announced in the commerce space. I want to understand how those partnerships might evolve over the next couple years, what Google brings to the table for those partners, what it might do for the advertising services business as we think long-term. And then we've been getting a lot of questions on Waymo in the quarter. Is there any sense you can give us of some of the key investment milestones, or how we should be thinking about capital allocated to the Waymo business in the coming years? Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bGreat. On the commerce -- on the commerce front, you know, obviously it's a natural sector I think for us to drive partnerships. You know, we already have deep advertising relationships with many of these providers. Increasingly, shopping is an area where we are beginning to work together. And, finally, I think, you know, Cloud is another important way by which we can start working together.\nSo I do think we are seeing a lot of traction there. I gave the Carrefour example. We also announced a strategic partnership and significant investment in JD.com, the second largest eCommerce company in China.\nToday we're already -- for example, in Google Express, we are partnering with over 100\n\n merchants, including national retailers like Walmart, Costco, Target, Walgreens and PetSmart. So, there's a lot of traction. You know, I think we are building upon these relationships, trying to have more holistic conversations across the breadth of our offerings. And I think, you know, I see -- I see them all being very synergistic.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bAnd then in terms of Waymo, we remain very excited about the opportunity. With Waymo, you've seen us talk about our progress on a number of fronts. I think the main point, it is still very early.\nBut in terms of our progress, so 2018, the focus has been to launch the commercial rider program in Phoenix that we've talked about, looking to do that by year-end. We do view that as a first step in building a more fully rolled out rider program in the future. And as we've discussed on prior calls, we continue to trial the program in Phoenix with an emphasis on delivering a safe experience that delights users.\nWe've also continued to build out our vehicle relationships. You saw announcements regarding FCA and Jaguar. We're expanding our testing to more states.\nWe're also working on additional areas such as logistics and deliveries. We talked this past quarter about licensing the technology for personal-use vehicles, and we're also focused on working with cities to help strengthen public transportation.\nYou know, more specifically, your focus on capex, as I said, we're excited about the long-term opportunity; but creation of a new market does take time. And then on the capex versus opex, the way it works is once the commercial program is up and running beyond what's viewed as more of a development or R&D phase, then much of the investments are capex versus opex. And that's for cars, sensors, and any other spend.\nSo, you know, we're excited. We do think it's a really important market, but it is still very early. Eric Sheridan (UBS): \u200bThank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): \u200bGreat. I just had two questions. One, I was wondering if you could talk about what you've seen thus far with the roll-out of GDPR. Anything you could share with us and just how that's played out versus your expectations at this point. And then, Sundar, as you mentioned, with Google Next upon us and, you know, you obviously -- guys are talking very positively about the business. But are there any more stats you can share with us, even about the growth rates in G Suite or GCP or combined? And then, you know, when we think about this business scaling over time, is there any reason to think that the pace of gross margin progression would be materially different than, say, Azure, AWS at similar revenue levels? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bThanks, Heather. On GDPR, obviously it's something we've been working on for a long time, well over 18 months, but the roll-out just happened towards the end of second quarter. So it's a bit early to assess anything. But, you know, for us, you know,\n\n it's been super important to get it right. And we've always been focused on user privacy, but it's been a big change for a lot of our partners as well. And so we're working closely with our partners and regulators and -- you know, and committed to doing it right. But it's too early to tell.\nAnd on Google Next and Cloud, you know, obviously the conference is tomorrow. So, you know, I will -- I will hold for the announcements -- announcements there.\nYou know, couple things. G Suite is definitely, you know, I think seeing a lot of momentum. You know, definitely I've noticed in the -- you know, now I think it's -- it can definitely serve the needs of a large enterprise. It's clear. I gave the Carrefour example. But, increasingly, we're seeing big companies take on the migration. So that's been for sure a positive development.\nAnd on Cloud, you know, I think we're investing for the long run. We are definitely seeing -- seeing traction. A lot of our effort, you know, from a product and technology standpoint, we're definitely there and differentiated. It's been a lot about investing in our go-to-market efforts. And as we do it, both developing our in-house strengths but as well as partnering, those things are beginning to pay dividends. And, you know, hopefully you'll hear more details at tomorrow's conference.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): \u200bThank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): \u200bThanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the Google Assistant and the Hardware on the Google Home Minis, I was curious if you could just talk about sort of early learnings and differences in consumer behavior with how they interact with those devices as opposed to mobile search on the phones. And I know you're always very focused on the long-term value proposition for users and advertisers. Maybe talk to what the focus and the hardware is long-term for users and advertisers. And, Sundar, I appreciate your color on India, Indonesia and the emerging markets. Talk about how you're strategically trying to position yourself to have a business potentially beyond advertising and payments and other areas in those countries, if you could, please.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bSo on Google Assistant, you know, obviously we see Google Assistant as an important evolution. And, you know, obviously it's early days, but it's already exciting to see. You know, people definitely are pushing the boundaries of what they can do with these devices. And home control and automation is a good example of the kind of use case that's very, very different consumer behavior and which is why our assets in Nest, et cetera, end up mattering over time. You know, there's a lot more actions. People are trying to get things done, which is definitely, you know, areas where we are focused on.\nBut I think it's important to understand that the experience not just in the context of Home and Home Mini but also the core mobile experience, how it evolves on the phone and across the screens you will have in your life. So we are taking the end-to-end user experience in mind, and that's where all the investments we have done over many, many years I think will come into play as the product evolves.\n\n On your question about emerging markets, you know, the user growth there is, you know, extraordinary to see. And we're seeing it across all our products. So all our major products, products which have over a billion users each, they're all doing well in these markets. And so that's where most of the growth is going to come from. And so it's an important area of focus.\nAnd we do see unique opportunities in these markets which are, you know, different from the market -- the markets we are in here, in our more mature markets. You highlighted payments as a good example, and you've seen us address that specifically with Google Tez in India.\nAnd so we will look to do more like that. And beyond just getting our products working better, we\u2019re going to be opportunistic. We're investing in talent in these countries. And there's a lot of innovation which is going to happen from these countries, both for their own markets and for the world beyond. And we want to be in a position to do that well.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): \u200bGreat. Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDouglas Anmuth (JP Morgan): \u200bThanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First for Ruth. You've talked about the higher costs as you shift to machine learning-driven business and also your tech upgrade cycle around machines. Can you give us a sense of where you are in making those transitions and absorbing those investments from a cost perspective? And then, Sundar, mobile strength clearly in the quarter. Can you just help us understand better how machine learning and AI are driving the stronger growth in mobile search and if there's any specific innovations or products you can point to that are driving that outsized growth. Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bSo in terms of your first question and kind of machine learning, and I think you're kind of getting at cycle, you're really seeing it in two places. Part of it as I called out is with respect to opex, we\u2019re hiring -- what you're seeing is the investments we're making across the board, you know, it's Ads, it's Cloud, it's Hardware, it's the Assistant but it is also very much in machine learning. And we're really proud of the team that we have, given the opportunity set that they're able to address.\nAnd then I think you were -- you were getting more broadly at capex. You know, the way\nwe're -- we're focused on capex. As I said last quarter as well, we view this as a lens into our outlook for growth and the required additional compute capacity. And, you know, there are a number of growth drivers there. And, you know, part is really to support growth that we're seeing in our Search and Ads business. That's really consistent with the momentum that we've commented on today and the exciting opportunities that we see to further enhance the user and advertiser experience, it\u2019s also for our newer businesses, as I noted in opening comments. And then very importantly it reflects the importance of machine learning across our products, including Search and Ads.\nWe've talked about this in the past, machine learning is more compute intensive but it also opens up more services and products across Alphabet. And that's what we're investing in to make sure that we've got the capacity with, you know, best-in-class compute capacity.\n\n And so the -- you know, the build is really machines, data centers and network infrastructure. And just to make sure, to put a fine point on it, while we are ensuring that we are well-positioned to support the growth we see, we do constantly remain focused on efficiency per unit of compute. We've talked about that on many prior calls and are investing here for long-term value creation thoughtfully in order to be able to pursue the opportunities that we see ahead of us.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bAnd, Doug, on your question on how is machine learning driving the mobile search experience, you know, I think the key thing is it's doing it at a deeper foundational level. We've obviously used machine learning across the board, be it our ranking, in actually understanding the intent, the context around the query, and getting you the right answer. I think the experiences -- I mean, the improvements are happening continuously. And so we are -- and I would just say they are getting deeper in terms of what we are able to do.\nIn terms of specific innovations or products -- it's super important to understand I gave the Translate example earlier. While it may seem like a specific use case, you know, it's obviously -- obviously we can do Translate well because of machine learning. But where it helps us is we want Google to be the source you think of when you run into a problem.\nAnd the fact that, you know, the data shows that during the World Cup in Russia our usage spiked up, to me shows that when people are running into new things, new experiences, when they have questions on their mind, Google is what they are reaching out to. And I think the way we continue to do that well is by -- increasingly by using machine learning. So that's the depth to which we think about this.\nDouglas Anmuth (JP Morgan): \u200bGreat. Thank you both.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of\nEvercore. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): \u200bThank you very much. First, for Sundar, you talked about Android in your prepared remarks. In your blog post, you said that you're concerned that the Android ruling from the EC sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platforms. So I wonder, how are you thinking about the possible business impact from this Android ruling, specifically untying the Play Store from Search and the Chrome browser? And does it in any way change your strategic approach for Android going forward?\nAnd then for Ruth, on the theme of opex investment trends, if we isolate just the Other Revenue businesses -- Cloud, Play and Hardware -- all growth drivers but clearly structurally different in terms of the competitive landscape and profitability. You said most of the headcount additions are in Cloud. But would love to understand more about how you prioritize investment across Cloud, Play and Hardware, those three. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bOn Android, as I said in my blog post, you know, Android has really worked well I think globally for users, for everyone in the ecosystem. You can clearly see there's robust competition. There's a lot of innovation, lower prices that has made Android possible at every price point. So I think overall it's created more choice for everyone, not less.\n\n We have definitely -- you know, it's -- we are analyzing the decision, and I think it's too early to comment or speculate beyond what we've already said. But we will -- you know, we will always take a constructive approach. We'll appeal the Commission's decision and take the due process available to us.\nBut we are also looking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the, you know, enormous benefits of Android to users and so on. So there is more work to be done, and I think it will become clearer as we go along. But I'm confident that we can find a way to make sure Android is available at scale to users everywhere.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bAnd in terms of your question on investment priorities, I think one of the most important points to underscore is that one of the biggest opportunities for investment continues to be in our Ads business where we're continuing to invest meaningfully, given the opportunity set that we see there.\nSundar commented on some of them, as did I, you know, looking at opportunities to enhance the user experience, to continue to improve tools for advertisers. And, you know, both of which extend the growth there, and that's for mobile. And what we're increasingly seeing is as we focus on mobile, the benefits are cross-platform and help explain the growth we're seeing in desktop and YouTube. So we are continuing to invest here. I don't want to leave you with an answer with a notion that the investment is just going to be newer businesses.\nAnd then more specifically to your question, you know, what we look at is the opportunity set, the -- you know, each one of these is different. When we start with Cloud, as Sundar commented, given the core capabilities that we are building upon, our technical infrastructure, security, apps, machine learning, analytical tools, our view is that we're addressing a rapidly growing market with the core pillars that are needed to win.\nAnd what has been the recurring theme that we've talked about on these calls is the need to further build out our go-to-market capabilities and ensure that we've got the functional requirements that enterprise customers deserve. So it's really looking at the scale of the opportunity, the pace of investment that can be done effectively and, therefore, position us well.\nYou know, our Hardware business continues to deliver significant growth, particularly with the sales of the Home family of products, and you've seen us invest there. We talked about the HTC acquisition last quarter. Because this is a scale business and the ability to operate as effectively as possible underscores the types of investment we're making.\nPlay continues to benefit from broad-based app strength. It's been a long-standing strength of ours, and we're continuing to invest as needed there.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): \u200bThank you both.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): \u200bGreat. Thanks. Two questions. It seems like your commentary on Cloud is very positive. It seems like that's also what we're hearing from Microsoft and my guess\n\n is from Amazon and what they're seeing. Do you think we're just at a broad industry inflection point in terms of Cloud adoption? And any thoughts as to why we're seeing it now?\nAnd then I have a question on advertising, there's this big bucket of ad spend called trade promotion spend that's largely been offline, I think. And it's almost as big maybe on a global basis as kind of traditional TV brand advertising. Any thoughts on that as an opportunity, whether there's an ability for that to really migrate heavily online and Google's ability to tap into those dollars? Thank you very much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bOn the first question on Cloud, you know, for sure, you know, I do think there is, you know, an inflection point, and that's why it feels far from a zero-sum game. I think all the major players are definitely seeing traction.\nAnd to me, the reason is typically when you look at Enterprises, once you've deployed and you have an architecture, you try to stay on it as long as you can in many, many cases because change is hard. But this is a case in which the benefits are super clear. And over time, I think there's a tremendous cost to your business of being on the wrong architecture, especially if you need to digitally transform yourself. You know, thinking through the Cloud architecture becomes an important way by which you're improving your business.\nSo I think at a foundational level, it's clearly there on everyone's minds. It's not just on -- you know, CEOs are asking questions about Cloud. Almost all businesses I deal with I can clearly see the question is on the mind of their CEO, and so I think -- I think it's important.\nI also think it's going to be -- businesses are going to embrace multiple clouds over time, too. So I think not only is this early but I think it is going to, you know, transform. And there's a lot of opportunity here. And our goal here is something -- we view this is something we have built experience over 20 years. And we are thoughtfully, you know, gaining strength and committed to it for the very long term.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bAnd then in terms of kind of trends in advertising, to your question, you know, we -- we have talked about this quite a bit in the past, over 90% of commerce is still offline and we do see a great opportunity for digital to play a bigger role in that and tap into our budgets, into other budgets that have traditionally been there.\nAnd so we are quite focused on the advertising opportunity, as I've said. And the fact that ad budgets are offline and as we focus on the user opportunity and the tools for advertisers, we view that as another opportunity.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): \u200bThanks, Ruth. Thanks, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): \u200bGood afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, or highlighted at least, the launch of Local Campaigns at Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. I recognize that's an initiative that will help drive demand across a number of Google properties. But I'm curious in particular about Maps and with it\n\n being a product aimed at driving store visits, one would assume Maps will play an interesting part in that. And, you know, in the past when we've asked you about Maps, it was focused more on getting the user experience right. So my question is, is do you see Local Campaigns as something that drives a bit of an incremental level of monetization of Maps? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Look, I think it's a good question. You know, local is an extraordinary use case in mobile. Local mobile searches are growing faster than mobile searches for us. And they've increased by almost 50% in the last year alone. And we are continuing to invest in building a local experience that benefits merchants, users and advertisers.\nAnd Local Campaigns are something new which we announced at Google Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. It's a new campaign where if you're a local business, it's designed to drive foot traffic to you. You provide us with your budget, business locations and creatives and we use machine learning to automatically optimize the ads to appear across our properties, right?\nAnd along with that, you've rightly noticed that we are, you know, beginning to experiment with new ad formats which we've had in beta but we're pushing on them a bit more in Maps itself both Promoted Places and Place Page ads.\nSo these are important ways by which we are exploring the commercial opportunity around Maps. I've always felt Maps is a tremendous asset we have. And we've really focused on the user side of things, and we will continue to do so because the growth is very, very high. So we see a lot of headroom.\nAnd -- but as that experience, you know, is -- you know, we get a better understanding of it, we are developing our views on how we can bring monetization experiences. So these are all steps in that direction, but, you know, we'll take it slowly and we'll continue to evolve it here.\nDan Salmon (BMO): \u200bOkay, great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): \u200bGood afternoon. Ruth, the U.S. and Asia business accelerated sequentially modestly. But Europe was down a touch, and I think there have been many questions around, did GDPR have any impact, and Sundar said it was too early to call. But is that just completely unrelated to what happened? Maybe there's something else that's going on that resulted from the small downtick?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bYeah, I mean, the way we look at it is we're pleased with the strength in each of the regions. At 19% year-on-year growth in EMEA on a fixed basis, we're pleased with the strength in the business. And as Sundar said, I think it is too early to comment on GDPR.\nWe then, you know, hope that the geographic split gives you a better sense of what's kind of the dynamics in each of the various regions.\n\n And as we both commented on, as long as you raised the regional question, I've got to comment on APAC here. Really pleased with the growth, 34% on a fixed FX basis. And it underscores Sundar's comments about terrific products and rapidly growing markets as well as a superb leadership group.\nMobile strength is the key there as well, and we're really pleased about the breadth by country that we're seeing. We're very focused on the region. So as we look across the globe, we're pleased with the fact that it is -- all regions are contributing nicely.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): \u200bOkay. And a quick follow-up for Sundar. You mentioned on the Cloud business that you're getting strong traction among some of the big financial institutions. One of the big questions we get is around the heavily regulated industries like healthcare, financial. It feels like you're starting to get better reference-ability there. Are you happy with where you sit across the more heavily regulated industries now versus the tech-focused industries where you sit right now?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bYou know, definitely. And I think that's where a lot of our investments have gone in, right? Getting the necessary certifications needed, depending on the industry and building the feature set you need. And, you know, that's clearly starting to have an impact and -- both on GCP but as well as G Suite.\nAnd so we definitely are going to continue to build out our capabilities and, you know, we'll be going after the opportunities in these areas, you know, very seriously.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): \u200bThank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert\nW. Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): \u200bOkay, thanks very much. I have a couple. Maybe first going back to the commerce theme. I wanted to ask about Shopping Actions and the level of adoption you might be seeing with that format and more generally where you envision monetization for Google Assistant, if we should still expect to see more of a transactional bent to that platform.\nAnd then on TAC, Ruth, I wonder if it's worth adding a little more color perhaps on the timing or how much of the second quarter benefited from the moderation in growth in Sites TAC, just so we can get a better sense as to how to model that expense item over the next few quarters. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bColin, on Google Assistant and Shopping Actions, you know, there -- you know, I do think it's been exciting to see the improvement there. But, you know, I still would like the experience to evolve a lot more before, you know, we play around with monetization.\nAnd in all of these areas, we always have a high bar to make sure the user experience is working well. You have seen us do that with Maps or something like that.\nAnd, you know, I think today, while we have taken promising steps with Shopping Actions, for 16\n\n all of this to really work well and to delight users, you know, I still feel we have some work ahead of us, and that's what we are focused on.\nSo we'll -- we'll stay focused there, get the experience, and then that will give us new avenues to monetize it. You know, I've seen this with YouTube now. Beyond ads we're experimenting with a lot of new formats and the same thing here. So, you know, I'm pretty confident of our ability to do that well, if we get the user experience right.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bAnd then in terms of TAC, as we've talked about in the past, TAC as a percentage of revenues is affected by quite a number of factors. The main point is that we do continue to expect the TAC rate to increase on a year-on-year basis. And the primary reason is the one we've talked about with you in the past. It's -- it's the underlying shift to mobile which carries higher TAC than desktop, so on a year-on-year basis, that's the trend that you're really seeing, is the ongoing strength of mobile.\nYou know, over the past four quarters, changes in partnership agreements have also been a driver of increases in the TAC rate and then there are a host of other factors that we've talked about that can have an impact in any quarter, like device mix or partner mix, or mix of organic and paid distribution points.\nAnd so as we called out last quarter, we did expect the pace of year-on-year growth in the Sites TAC rate to slow beginning in this quarter, the second quarter. And you can clearly see that in the data. And as we've repeatedly said, it is most instructive to focus on year-on-year changes, given the significance of the shift to mobile and mobile growth. And so variations in quarter-on-quarter moves are less instructive.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): \u200bThank you.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of\nMoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): \u200bThanks. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, firstly, you went through a lot of your initiatives in your opening comments but didn't mention Verily. So can you talk a bit about what the bottlenecks are that need to be solved, either by you or your clients, before you could scale the Verily opportunity.\nAnd then for Ruth, you've been clear in the capex ramp is due to your investing ahead of growth. What is the usual time frame, do you think, do you see where those investments pay off? And what factors would make the capex-to-sales ratio start growing even faster from here? So those are my questions.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bYou know, broadly, you know, Verily is you know, clearly set up as an Other Bet, and they're doing really important work on healthcare, you know, if you look at the recent progress on their, you know, diabetes monitoring and so on. So they're in deep work, and they will have a lot more to talk about.\nAcross healthcare you see a big opportunity for both Google and Alphabet. It's a vertical, which is very important for Cloud. And, you know, we are obviously, you know, helping a lot of\n\n healthcare partners across their needs. And Verily is definitely doing very specialized solutions in this area. And we'll have a lot more to say on all of this over the course of time.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bAnd then with respect to capex, look, you know, I think our view is that what you're seeing here is an aggressive pace of investment given our outlook for growth and, as I've said, the required additional compute capacity.\nWe're quite focused on the, you know, kind of full resource utilization across businesses. If I go back a couple of years when we incorporated stock-based compensation into the way we're talking about the businesses, I made the point that that is helpful, both externally and internally.\nAnd looking at resource utilization the same is clearly true -- of capex. And we're quite focused on long-term value creation, focused on ensuring that we're pursuing attractive opportunities, you know, in a prudent, appropriate way to capture the opportunity while making sure that we're looking at the full, again, resource requirement.\nSo at this point, that's an interesting way of framing the question, how does it grow even faster from here. We're quite focused on this being an aggressive pace and an appropriate one, given the opportunity set that we see. And it is across data centers, machines and network infrastructure, as I said.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): \u200bThanks, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of\nMerrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): \u200bGreat. Thank you. I just want to get into Website growth. First, maybe you can help us a little bit understand strength in mobile search. Are there any new ad formats or ad changes? You mentioned local. Anything to call out there? And then, just wondering, given the YouTube controversies last year, did YouTube accelerate this quarter? And what are some of the big content areas that you're investing in? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: \u200bSo in terms of Sites revenue, you know, I think our view is the ongoing strength reflects our focus on improving the user experience and enhancing tools for advertisers. And both Sundar and I have spoken about them. You know, we've had an intense focus on innovation that we've discussed previously that's enabled us to deliver over 100 innovations each quarter.\nAnd a really exciting area is the benefit of machine learning. It's a valuable driver of our growth, not only enhancing experiences for users but, you know, the tools that we talked about for advertisers and for app developers, really helping them find the right audience to be able to optimize campaigns at scale, to deliver more relevance and higher quality ads.\nSundar talked about a number of them. You know, the Google Marketing Live, we really highlighted what we're seeing there and the benefits, whether we're talking about Responsive Search Ads or Local Campaigns, Smart Shopping campaigns. Another great example is Universal App Campaigns. So, you know, across the board -- and again, I've made this comment previously, but the benefit we're seeing on mobile is extending to the growth\n\n opportunities across platforms.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: \u200bYeah. And, you know, I would add that, a good way to think about it is, today there's a lot of complexity you need to deal with as an advertiser. Increasingly we are using machine learning to do all the hard work and get them to focus on the business problem they are trying to solve. And, you know, that turns out to be a big driver overall.\nOn YouTube, you know, we definitely are continuing to see great product momentum. It's the user adoption and interest, and our -- our metrics are very strong, continues to grow, and the growth is global. And we see it across many, many verticals.\nAnd overall, we've invested a lot in making sure we are delivering the content responsibly. And it's been a big area of focus across Google. We're investing a lot in people to review the content that's going on, you know, improving the policies, and again using machine learning to make all of this work better.\nAnd I think people are noticing it, including our advertisers and, you know -- and they're engaging with the platform more. So I would say overall there's a lot of momentum there, and I'm excited about it.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bThank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: \u200bGreat. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call.\nCandice (Operator): \u200bLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.", "20183": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q3 2018 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q3 2018 Earnings Call October 25, 2018\nCandice (Operator): Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet third quarter 2018 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star and then zero on your touch-tone telephone. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference call over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.\nNow I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search, with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and Desktop Search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year, and up 22% in constant currency. For today\u2019s call, I will begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.\nStarting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter: our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million, or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions: US revenues were $15.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11.0 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year, and up 30% in constant currency. Other Americas revenues\n\n were $1.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year, and up 28% in constant currency reflecting weakening of the Brazilian Real and the Argentine Peso.\nOn a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were: costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continued to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses; and content-acquisition costs -- primarily for YouTube.\nOperating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud and Ads, followed by advertising investments in Cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season, and the Google Assistant. G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A primarily to other cost of revenues.\nStock-based compensation totalled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizeable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.\nOperating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year, for an operating margin of 25%. As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we\u2019ve provided a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line items.\nOther income and expense was $1.8 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter, reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the US Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06.\nTurning now to capex and operating cash flow. Cash capex for the quarter was $5.3 billion, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13.2 billion with free cash flow of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $106 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results.\nStarting with the Google segment. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $24.1 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other\n\n revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud and Play.\nWe continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $6.6 billion, or 23% of total advertising revenues, and up 20% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was relatively flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, offset by an increase in the Sites TAC rate. The increase in the Sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in the Network TAC rate due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totalled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year, and the operating margin was 28.2%. Accrued capex for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities.\nLet me now turn to Other Bets. Revenues were $146 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $727 million. Other Bets accrued capex was $55 million.\nIn terms of Other Bet updates for the quarter. With Waymo, in the third quarter we built on our Early Rider Program, both expanding the group of participants and beginning to test pricing models. At Verily the team continues to execute on its various partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies consistent with its mission to move medicine from reactive to proactive. Recently launched efforts include a joint venture with ResMed to focus on sleeping disorders and a research collaboration with Gilead. Finally, you can see in our results the benefit and quality of our investment teams -- GV and CapitalG -- which are also within Other Bets. Within the $1.4 billion of reported gains in equity securities in OI&E, approximately $400 million was realized in Q3. There will be more detail on these investment activities in the 10-Q.\nLet me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook.\nFirst, with respect to Revenues. In the third quarter, results reflect FX headwinds with US dollar strengthening in contrast to the tailwinds that enhanced reported results in the first half of the year. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strengths in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers. As we noted, Hardware was only a modest contributor in the third quarter, as we launched a new \u201cMade by Google\u201d family of products for the fourth quarter holiday season.\nSecond, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. We indicated on the fourth quarter 2017 call that the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites Revenues would begin to slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that again clearly in our results this quarter. As frequently discussed, we do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales, from Hardware sales, which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year, as well as from increased content acquisition costs for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth\n\n quarter.\nWithin opex, we continue to prioritize our investments to support long term growth. In terms of headcount, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter, because we brought on new graduates. We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management and to support our most sizeable growth areas, in particular Cloud. As I\u2019ve mentioned previously regarding sales and marketing, expenses are more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. As you have seen in prior years, these expenses are particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season.\nOther Bets remains a portfolio of earlier stage businesses focused on addressing sizable markets. We are moving toward early stages of commercialization, while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment against achievement of key milestones.\nAnd finally, with respect to Capex you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses. This includes a number of data center construction projects in flight, as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity.\nI will now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Ruth. We had a great quarter -- and it was particularly special because last month we celebrated Google\u2019s 20th birthday and the 10th birthday of Chrome. It\u2019s exciting to think that 20 years in, we\u2019re still just at the beginning of what\u2019s possible. We get billions of questions from users every day and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before. Our mission to make the world\u2019s information accessible and useful is as relevant today as when we started.\nI want to begin by highlighting our recently-launched family of hardware. It\u2019s a great example of how we bring together Google\u2019s strengths to help people through their day. Then, I\u2019ll touch on ways AI is helping us approach our mission, I\u2019ll give an update on our video and advertising platforms, and finally, I\u2019ll talk about our growing Cloud business.\nFirst, Hardware. Every year, we have a new opportunity to push the boundaries of computing. Those experiences come to life in our Made by Google hardware, which combines the latest advances in software, hardware, and AI. Our third generation is our best yet. It includes the Pixel 3, Google Home Hub, the Pixel Slate tablet, and more. We\u2019re getting great feedback and I\u2019m very excited for users to try these devices, especially as the holiday season approaches.\nOur new hardware lineup showcases the best of Google, including the Google Assistant, Android, and Chrome. With the Pixel 3, we\u2019ve used AI to create a best-in-class camera. New features like Top Shot make it so you never miss a shot. If your timing wasn\u2019t perfect, the camera will suggest a better frame and give you the option to save it. And Night Sight will help you take really good pictures even in bad light. Pixel 3 also has a custom security chip called Titan M. It was built to secure Google\u2019s own data centers, and now we\u2019re bringing it to our users.\n\n We also released Google Home Hub, our first smart speaker with a screen. It shows your morning commute, lets you control your smart home, and gives you hands-free help in the kitchen. And Pixel Slate, Chrome OS reimagined as a tablet, with all the great apps from the Play Store.\nOur hardware efforts are picking up real momentum. For example, daily active users of our Google Home devices have grown by over 5x in the last year alone. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our growing Hardware team -- including the talented employees who came over from HTC and Nest. Our investments are paying off as we bring the best of Google to more users and in more countries around the world.\nEven as we build up our hardware business, we continue to advance our mission across our core products and platforms. Last month, we kicked off 20 years of Google Search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years. They include: a new AI-powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results; a redesigned Google feed -- called Discover -- to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you; and a new search experience for Google Images.\nWe also continue to tackle the information problem of connecting people to relevant jobs, right from Search. This has already helped connect over 100 million people in 92 countries to job listings that meet their needs and skills. Now, US service members can search for \u201cjobs for veterans\u201d and enter their military occupational code to see relevant civilian jobs.\nThe Google Assistant continues to gain traction -- drawing on our strengths in machine learning and helpful Google services like Search, YouTube and Maps. We\u2019ve expanded the Assistant to 20 languages and 76 countries -- and it can now understand and speak more than one language at a time. We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL, as well as our own Google Home Hub. Pixel users in the US will be the first to try our new Duplex technology, which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone, like calling a restaurant to book a table. And we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant.\nIn Maps, we also made several improvements, including a commute tab with live traffic and transit information and support for mixed-mode commutes.\nEarlier this month, we announced an exciting test -- called Project Stream. We\u2019re working with video game publisher Ubisoft to stream their latest game Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey to Chrome browsers on laptops and desktops. Streaming graphically rich content for video games represents a great technical advance, and we look forward to seeing what\u2019s possible here.\nI\u2019m particularly proud of how our strengths in AI are creating life-changing contributions in other fields. For example, our recent flood prediction efforts -- which use AI to better predict when floods will occur -- have the potential to help millions of people get out of harm\u2019s way. We are starting in India, where 20% of flood-related fatalities occur today, and we\u2019re looking to expand to more countries soon. Earlier this month, our researchers showed how they\u2019ve applied deep learning models to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for metastatic breast cancer. Our research found that pathologists and AI can work together more effectively than either alone.\n\n Moving to our video and advertising platforms, which are creating economic opportunities for partners around the world.\nFirst, YouTube. One particular area of focus is educational content. Every day, people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new -- from career skills to coding to cooking. Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube Learning initiative, which will help fund established and emerging educational creators. We\u2019re also partnering with organizations like Goodwill and YearUp to create curated playlists that teach career skills directly in our new Learning channel.\nYouTube\u2019s ads business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators. At Advertising Week, we announced that we\u2019ll be expanding our popular TrueView for Actions format. This helps users take action directly from video ads. They can now do things like sign up for a newsletter, and soon they\u2019ll be able to find movie showtimes, download apps or even book a trip -- right from the ad. For creators, YouTube is continuing to build alternative revenue products, like Super Chat, Channel Memberships, and the ability to sell merchandise directly to fans. YouTube gaming creator Markiplier increased his revenue by 20% using Channel Memberships. We continue to see positive traction for our newer subscription experiences too. YouTube Premium, YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium are continuing to expand to many new countries. The team is also investing in growing and improving the news experience on YouTube. More prominently surfacing credible news sources on the platform is a big priority for us.\nNext, our advertising platforms. Advertisers love that we\u2019re bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like Responsive Search Ads and Universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads. One new example is Smart Shopping campaigns, which use signals like seasonality and price to optimize where ads are shown. Tens of thousands of advertisers are using this -- and seeing an average of 20% more sales for the same budget.\nJust last week, we announced that Nike, Best Buy, and Sephora are joining our Shopping Actions program. This allows people to move seamlessly from browsing to buying with a universal cart that works across Google Search and the Assistant. In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices. Unity\u2019s developers can monetize their apps with Google ads without any additional development work.\nAnd lastly, our growing Cloud business. At Google Cloud Next, we made over 100 announcements, including the Titan Security Key, which features Google-designed firmware to help verify that nothing on a customer\u2019s key has been tampered with. And we expanded our breakthrough Cloud AutoML portfolio, which now includes Vision, Natural Language, and Translation.\nAnd all over the world, we\u2019re seeing great customer adoption of our Cloud platform. With the help of SAP, METRO, one of the largest B2B wholesalers globally, is centralizing their finance system on Google Cloud Platform. They\u2019re using BigQuery to generate data-driven insights to help create more personalized marketing campaigns. In the US, we partnered with the National Institutes of Health to provide access to cloud services that help researchers access large\n\n datasets to accelerate biomedical advances. We also added new customers like ING and Broadcom, joining existing customers like PayPal, ANZ Bank and Kroger.\nOur G Suite business continues to fuel transformation in companies large and small, and we crossed two important milestones in the quarter. Google Drive became the eighth Google product with one billion monthly active users. And Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users. One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand Uniqlo, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite while also pursuing AI solutions, like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform. Our Cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure, including a US-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia, as well as the investments that we\u2019re making in the US. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong. This is a reflection of our very focused efforts to build great experiences for the billions of people across the region. We\u2019ve adapted many of our core products like Search, Maps, and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online. We\u2019re also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region, like Tez, a digital payments app for India, to help people easily pay their electrician or split a dinner bill with just a few taps. Just one year since it launched, over 30 million people and businesses across India now use the app every month, and they have collectively made more than 1 billion transactions. We recently rebranded the app to Google Pay as we look to bring many of the app\u2019s features to others around the world.\nWe\u2019re also investing closer to home. In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet\u2019s total capital expenditures was within the US. Not only do these investments in data centers, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses. This year to date, we have added over 9,000 new employees in the US. And we continue to grow faster outside the Bay Area than in it.\nAs you can see, there\u2019s exciting momentum across many different areas. I\u2019m constantly struck by the number of incredible opportunities ahead of us as a company, and how far we\u2019ve come over the last 20 years. I want to say a big thank you to all of the Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day.\nWith that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on the phone lines, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star and then the number 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for Sundar if I can.\n\n Referencing the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of Search, wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that Search becomes more visual or relevant and what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products, relevancy of ads over the medium to long-term. And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers that there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines. It sounds like the YouTube announcements coming out of AdWeek were about making YouTube more responsive or more direct response. How are you thinking about the blurring of those lines and what it means for product development long-term? Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Eric. I'll take the two. The first on Search, you're right that, you know -- I mean, with Search we're always trying to anticipate where users -- what the user experience expectations are, and trying to meet them there. And increasingly in mobile, you know, people do want immersive, engaging experiences. They want experiences to be more visual. And that's partly what you saw us announce in our 20th birthday event. And, you know, we are excited to move in that direction.\nAnd I do think we have a lot of important assets to bring here. YouTube is a big part of what we do. We are investing in image search, and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos which all add to that visual experience.\nAnd as part of doing that, you know, we are -- we are investing in our advertising offerings as well. And so over time, we'll adapt that so they go hand in hand. But I think it's an important evolution for us.\nIn terms of YouTube, I think -- I think -- you know, it is -- part of what makes YouTube great is I think we can offer different opportunities for advertisers. We've always felt direct response is something that can work well on YouTube and our instinct is bearing out. And I look at my personal use cases. There are many times now, sometimes instead of search, I actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place, and I research it on YouTube. So I think it offers the same opportunity over time. And from our standpoint, we want to make sure we are evolving the product to bring those opportunities to advertisers. So I'm very excited about it.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, two questions for you. First, earlier this month -- or it might have been late last month -- Sridhar Ramaswamy, your head of Ads and Commerce, left to go to a VC firm. I\u2019m betting that wasn\u2019t a surprise to you, but I\u2019m just hoping you could shed a little light on sort of succession planning for that important role and whether or not you expect any sort of broad changes to Ad product strategy. And then second, just amongst those announcements on the anniversary were the evolution of feed to Discover, and I recognize that\u2019s an evolution of a product but it does look like you are taking advantage of that long unused white space on Google.com. And so just love to hear a little bit more, sort of a\n\n follow-up on Eric's question on the evolution of Search but how you see that surface, in particular, evolving and particularly the potential for ad monetization over time. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Good. You know, on the first one, look, one of the things I'm really proud about Google is, we have a deep bench of talent and, for example, in the Ads team, almost all of our senior Ads leadership has been here for, you know, well over a decade. And so for us, we are fortunate to be able to tap into it. Our Ads leadership comes -- you know, Prabhakar, who has taken over our Ads product and engineering efforts, is someone I\u2019ve worked with for many, many years, and, you know, most recently has led our G Suite business but has done many roles before, is a deep computer scientist. And I expect to -- for him to continue our tradition of technical excellence with which we approach our advertising work.\nAlso want to mention Philipp and his team, his extraordinary team, who definitely lead many of our initiatives here; and Philipp and Prabhakar, with them I think it's in great hands and I expect a lot of continuity there.\nOn your question on Search and Discover, you know, in addition to making Search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question. So we feel our job is to be there when users need us, anticipate what they want and sometimes proactively meet them. That's where services like Discover really play a role, right? And we're thinking hard about how we can surface relevant information for our users, stuff they are really looking for, can act on, in a way in which it's delightful for them and is showing up for them when they need it. So I see that as an important evolution of Search as well. And so you're going to see us investing more.\nMobile offers us a great opportunity, and if you use it in Pixel 3, you know, that's the latest product in which we bring our vision of how to bring all these products together and will give you a good sense of how we plan to do that over time.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of\nEvercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): Great. Thank you for taking my questions. First for Sundar, you spent some time on Hardware, spent time discussing your suite of hardware devices, the Google Assistant, the Pixel. How are you measuring the returns on those investments in hardware, both in the products and on the marketing side here in a pretty competitive marketplace? What are the milestones for success that we should be looking for on hardware? And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for '19, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On hardware, you know, we always want to be at the forefront of computing. And, so, a lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users. And we genuinely see a very\n\n differentiated way to do this. We think of our approach of bringing together AI, software, and hardware is unique, and we think we can deliver the best-in-class experience and we are committed to doing it.\nAt the same time, we want to build a great business here as well, so we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well. So both go hand in hand.\nWe closely look at metrics, and the metrics -- we've been very focused on for the last couple of years, this is our third generation of hardware. It's the first time we actually are doing our products end-to-end and we've expanded to newer categories. We look at user feedback and reception. We measure NPS scores, and our scores are now reflecting best in class in the category. And beyond that, we are looking at how the market adoption is and we are thoughtfully building a business, but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it now, and many of the questions that have been already asked sort of point to the direction of it. We feel really good about the underlying strength in the Ads business as we've talked about on numerous calls. We continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities, in particular as we leverage machine learning to provide a better experience for users and for advertisers.\nAnd some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with Visual Search again continue to point the direction, direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused. But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it. And we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long-term. Sundar has already commented on both Hardware and Cloud as really important examples. And we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making are, provide foundational support for ongoing long-term, sustained growth.\nAnd so then we marry that with the second part of your question which is, and how do we think about the pace of investment. As we said repeatedly, we are very focused on investing for the long-term. We're trying to make sure that we prioritize crisply across the opportunity set that we have and we make the right types of trade-offs, but we do remain focused on long-term investing given the scale of the opportunities that we see.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): Got it. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thanks. Two questions please. One, Sundar, could you just update us with your thinking on China and the China market and the extent -- I know Google is already in that market, but the extent to which you want to expand, re-expand your presence there with Search. And then in terms of Waymo, just a quick question. Commercialization of Waymo, do you know when -- do you have a sense of when you'll have pricing established and you'll have a roughly well-defined and acted on go-to-market strategy with Waymo? Is that the end of this year, beginning of next year, whenever? Thank you.\n\n Sundar Pichai, CEO Google: And, Mark, on China, we obviously -- you know, we deeply care about serving Chinese users. We've been investing for many years, and especially from developing Android. But more recently, we've launched mobile apps, such as Google Translate and Files Go and, you know, improved our developer tools there. So we are -- we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users and that's where we are -- we are today.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you know, we extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group and we moved into very early days of commercialization. So we do now have people paying for rides, and we're also testing pricing models.\nI think the main point -- we\u2019ve said this repeatedly -- is that we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And so what that means is we're really expanding the program methodically. We're taking an iterative approach as we continue to broaden the geographic footprint. And then on top of that, as we've talked about on prior calls, we've been developing the B2B opportunities. So in Phoenix, as an example, we've been piloting with several partners who are sponsoring a service on behalf of their employees and customers. And, again, it's early days, so small revenues. But we're pleased to be testing this out as well.\nAnd then on top of that, continuing to explore, applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal-use vehicles and for last-mile solutions for cities. So you can see a move in the third quarter, but as we said repeatedly, it's very early days and we are taking a very deliberate iterative approach to broadening it out.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on Map monetization and putting some more ads in the Map, could you just talk about sort of\nearly -- early learnings there. I know you talked about local, mobile searches growing quite rapidly in the past, but any early learnings from the monetization and the return that advertisers are getting on that front? And the second one on video games and Project Stream, could you just talk a little bit about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale a direct-to-consumer facing Cloud gaming product.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Look, on the ads stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time, and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant, but I wouldn't underestimate the focus we have on local. Just to give you a sense, local mobile searches are growing faster than just mobile searches overall and have increased by almost 50% in the last year. So for us, that's an important focus area and Maps plays a big role there.\nSo we recently announced Local Campaigns, which is a new campaign type specifically designed to drive foot traffic to local businesses, right? And it's going to roll out in the coming --\n\n coming months. And so that is a big focus. As you pointed out, we are definitely launching and experimenting with newer ad formats on Maps itself. We have Promoted Places which appears on the Map itself. We have Place Page ads which appear on Google listings in Maps and Search. But we are definitely in the phase of, you know, putting those, testing it out, making sure the user experience works and making sure we can deliver value for advertisers. We are being patient here because the opportunity in local search, you know, it's a big opportunity and we are focused there.\nOn your second question, you know, look, we today serve our users on gaming across -- across Google, Alphabet in many ways, right? Obviously Google Play does this a lot. It's a big, important vertical on YouTube. And so we are -- so we touch -- you know, we touch, with gaming developers, across many areas already. And so we are thoughtfully thinking about what more we can do there.\nAnd Project Stream, you know, I -- having spent my life in computing, I was blown away by seeing our ability to stream a game which needs real-time interactions and to be able to do that from the cloud. And it's one of the most important technological advances I've seen in a while. And so we are going to focus on that and make sure we're making progress there and bring our newer experiences for gamers.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great, thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward and what impact do you see that having on financials? And then, Ruth, can you just talk about where you are in the hardware replacement cycle in your data centers? Pretty major step-up this year. Just given that large ramp, how are you thinking about the trajectory into '19? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Doug. On Europe, you know, it\u2019s early to say. We'll begin only implementing the remedy in the -- in the next few weeks. But in all these cases, you know, we always -- we're focused on complying with the Commission's directive and we want to make sure that the transition for both our users and our OEM partners is as smooth as possible. In this case, you're dealing with lifecycles for mobile phones, so change is just going to take some time to reach users. And it's difficult to predict how the licensing model will be adopted, but, you know, our products are very popular with users across platforms. And so it's early to say, but we are focused on doing the right thing there.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of technical infrastructure and our capex, as we talked about last quarter, capex reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core Ads and Search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses; in particular, to support Cloud and then very importantly, as we've talked about, machine learning across Alphabet. And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers.\n\n And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth. And that's what you're really seeing with the uptick in investment.\nTo give you a bit of a breakdown, the largest component continues to be machines, but relative to last year, it's important to note that data center construction is an increasing percentage of our capex investment. And so we're now in various stages of developing more than 20 data center sites globally. We're also investing in network infrastructure such as undersea cables so we can deliver speed and quality. So, again, this really goes to our view of the opportunity set.\nThat being said, we do remain very focused on optimizing the use of capex and also on compute efficiency. We're very mindful of the fact that our decisions here on capex don't just result in capex spend but also translate into higher depreciation expenses, and that goes both to cost of sales and opex. So very careful about how we're using it but want to make sure that we've built for the requirements that we have.\nAnd as much as you asked about technical infrastructure, just a quick note that our facilities spend -- namely, real estate -- was more muted this quarter and it was primarily just the ongoing work on our ground-up development. So you are primarily seeing what's going on -- on technical infrastructure here.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thank you both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of\nBarclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Great. Two questions. Ruth, so you guys posted pretty solid growth all around, but if we look at some of the international markets, each geography had a tougher comp and decelerated a little bit on a currency neutral basis. So I guess stepping back high level, the growth rates are solid but can you give us any color on the overall macro picture here. I think we're getting mixed feedback from different companies across different sectors. So any high-level comments would be -- would be helpful on just the ad market given that you're close to 20% of global advertising ex-China. And then, Sundar, a question on, I guess, Pixel and just the overall advancement you're seeing in smartphone devices. So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of, you know, your billion-plus apps like Search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the US and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and you keep adding these additional utilities? Is query volume going up on a per-user basis? Any color there would be helpful.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of your first question, we actually feel pretty good about the strength globally which I noted in opening comments -- you know -- across the board, 20% growth in the US on a $15 billion base. Sundar noted what's going on in APAC -- 30% year-on-year growth -- it's now over a $5 billion revenue business and we've had sustained quarter-after-quarter growth of this kind of 30-ish percent area. Feel really good about that. And by country, it really does reflect broad-based strength. As he said, we're very focused on the region. And I think we're delivering terrific products and experiences in rapidly\n\n growing markets.\nYou see the same thing in Other Americas, neutralizing for currency movements, 28% year-on-year growth. So we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And, you know, on your second question, you know, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there, integrated, and the experience is great -- we definitely see users engaging more. And so we see an opportunity, and that's one of the bigger reasons why we do hardware as well, to show that end-to-end experience -- both for our ecosystem -- as well as for us. It helps us give users a much deeper engaged experience as well. And, you know, when you look at all our products, we see that. And so we do see that as an opportunity.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks, hi, I have two for Sundar, kind of the same theme. One is on the Pixel 3. The marketing message is clear. The product looks great. But I wonder when you look at, to date, the success in ramping the product, what's been the gating factor? Has it been the carriers? Has it been the price? And when you look at the factors for why it hasn't scaled as much as the product should have scaled, what are the factors? And then, on Verily, you called out some deals you've had with big pharmaceutical companies this quarter. But, again, there I wonder, who's your most natural partnership? Is it hospitals? Insurance? Governments? So when you think about the big opportunity, where is the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on Pixel, look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware. Each generation, first of all, we have been scaling up the product in terms of even the number of units we can make and so on. So we -- if you remember the first couple generations, we were struggling to meet the early demand we saw.\nThis is the first year we have done it end-to-end and we are ramping up from there. And so each year when I look at all the metrics -- be it NPS or be it our sales, be it our reviews,\net cetera -- everything is progressing well. But there are -- you are right, the gating factors to ramp this up, first of all, is to be able to build the supply we need. And second is, you know, go to market, getting ourselves in as many locations in retail as possible, in as many countries as possible, with as many carrier certifications as possible. So in each of those dimensions, we are making progress as well.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: In terms of Verily, you know, what we\u2019ve talked about there is they have partnered with a whole host of leading pharmaceutical companies focusing on specific diseases, whether it's diabetic retinopathy or across the board for neurological diseases. They announced a couple or -- of new partnerships, the ResMed arrangement as well as Gilead. And that's what they tend to do. They partner with best in class to focus on specific areas where, working with the pharmaceutical companies, they can -- and the technology we have and benefiting from machine learning, we can really move from reactive to proactive care. That's the Verily focus.\n\n Michael Nathanson (Moffett): Thanks, Ruth. Thanks, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you. I just wanted to focus on Cloud a little bit more. Sundar, you gave some good color in your prepared remarks, but I'm wondering if you could share with us an update maybe on the partner momentum and direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that change. And also if you can highlight, you know, if you've noticed if there's been noticeable changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature. And, you know, you also -- in the beginning of the year and exiting Q4, you would give us some high-level growth commentary about GCP, and I'm just wondering if you have anything else you could share. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Heather. Look, overall, I mean, it's -- now we've been doing this seriously at the next level for three years and we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are -- the investment in product is clearly beginning to work. Our value proposition does come through in many competitive situations. I\u2019ve seen many important wins in what seem like very, very competitive situations.\nI also don't -- from the way we see it, it doesn't look like a zero-sum game, as you know. We're addressing a large market opportunity here. It seems like very early days.\nAnd more importantly, the general sense I get is we are very aligned with where the market is headed in the long run. This notion of supporting open architecture so that enterprises don't feel locked in -- and allowing -- allowing for a multi-cloud environment to develop. That's the direction we are betting on, and our indications are that the market is headed in that direction as well. So that gives us a lot of comfort -- that gives us a lot of comfort as well.\nAnd on the go-to-market side, we have really ramped up both in terms of our investments, our direct investments, but also our partnership strategy is beginning to work. And when I look at the pipeline ahead, you know, that, we are clearly seeing momentum there as well.\nYou know, in this business, you know, obviously the enterprise business plays in a way in which you do have wins, but those accounts turn into larger revenue deals over time. And so it's very clear to us that we are laying the foundation and we are getting the strong early momentum. And that's the big reason why we are investing in a strong way in the area. And over time we'll obviously share more here as well.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): And could I just ask one follow-up, if possible. I was just wondering if you look at Microsoft, they have an on-premise and cloud strategy. If you look at Amazon, what they are doing with AWS and VMware, they are kind of doing a similar strategy. Do you think there's a requirement for you to also have an on-premise strategy to solve this hybrid world as long as it's hybrid for? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, we are thoughtfully looking at it. We are increasingly working with partners like, for example, our partnership with SAP or Pivotal, VMware. These\n\n are all on hybrid cloud solutions. And so we are thinking about how to do that better. And our overall approach to cloud hybrid modernization I think is the right long-term direction, and so we are doing that.\nYou know, there are many, many situations we are in where on-prem is a big, big, big requirement for customers. But with our partnership approach, we've been able to address the needs well. So I don't see that as a gating issue for us.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks. Ruth, I just want to see if you could quantify the FX headwind. I think you were -- it was a negative 1% for Q3, and in Q4, do you anticipate it to be similar or a little worse?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: I will let you forecast the dollar. As you noted, it was -- it was a point here. We went from a tailwind in the second quarter to a one-point drag here going forward. But we called out, and we'll have more in the Q, but noted the impact. For example, a pretty big delta between our reported and fixed in Other Americas, 19% to 28% growth. And that was really what was going on with the Brazilian Real and the Argentine Peso. We saw some movements in other currencies around the globe. But you can see that, which is why we broke out the geography the way we have done it a number of quarters ago to try and give you -- help give a better sense of the types of headwinds. And I'll let you forecast the dollar.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Okay. We look forward to that. Real quick, just on EMEA, you were flat on your constant currency growth, 19%, 19% the last two quarters, despite with GDPR. So I would believe that would suggest that you're probably not seeing as big a headwind perhaps as maybe some expected. Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Specifically I think if your question is around GDPR and so on. You know, first of all, we've always been as a company very, very focused on user privacy and security. And so in some ways, you know, we were very early on engaged on GDPR, and we worked very hard to make sure our products are ready and in compliance.\nWe've generally always approached our products with a strong privacy lens for our users. So I think that helps us work through these changes because I don't think they are at odds with what we are trying to accomplish.\nI think GDPR is a very good and comprehensive set of regulations, and so I think it's been good to see a smooth transition on our products and for our users.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: We're continuing to invest significantly in Europe because we see the opportunity across Europe and are investing in the communities in which we're working.\n\n Brent Thill (Jefferies): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post at\nBank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Great. Thank you. One quick one for Ruth. People are really asking about Amazon. Just wondering if your eCommerce vertical was any different versus your other verticals in the quarter. Anything to call out there? And then secondly, Sundar, a lot of interesting things going on with YouTube and Waymo and Cloud and other areas. As you look out two or three years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on eCommerce, I mean, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see strong growth there as well. We see it as an important use case, and that's why we are investing a lot. If you look at our recent work with Shopping Actions, that's an example of the kind of work we are doing there, and when we do those things, we clearly see users respond.\nLike, for example, on Shopping Actions, I think we just recently had partnerships with Best Buy and Nike and Sephora. I mentioned it earlier.\nSo we are continuing to invest there, you know, and we\u2019re also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through Cloud, and I think that continues to be a big opportunity.\nAnd on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company, over the past 20 years, we've developed deep capabilities and technology in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI. And we see an opportunity to apply that across a set of important areas.\nThere are a lot of opportunities ahead of us. We are pretty disciplined about where we\u2019re focused on, and we are focused on real large opportunities. And when you mention areas like YouTube and Waymo and Cloud and Hardware, they all fit the category. But we take a very long-term view, and we want to invest to get the user experience right. And we are pretty confident that when we do that, the value will follow.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for\ntoday. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.", "20184": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q4 2018 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q4 2018 Earnings Call February 4, 2019\nCandice (Operator): Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star and then zero on your touch-tone telephone. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s fourth-quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Ellen. We had a strong 2018 with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers. For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion were up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency, as we continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search, with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud, and Desktop Search.\nFor today\u2019s call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.\nLet me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million, or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions.\nUS revenues were $18.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $12.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year in both reported and constant currency terms with a slight headwind, primarily from the Euro. APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year, and up 32% in constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar. Other Americas revenues were $2.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year, and up 26% in constant currency reflecting weakening of the Brazilian Real and the Argentine Peso.\nOn a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Other Cost of Revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were: first, content acquisition costs -- primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising-supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues. Second, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; and third, hardware-related costs for our Made by Google and Nest family of products.\nOperating expenses were $13.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses, with the larger driver being headcount growth, followed by the accrual of compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. Growth in Sales & Marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud and Ads, followed by advertising investments mainly in Search and the Assistant. The growth in G&A expenses reflects mostly increases in headcount. Stock-based compensation totalled $2.3 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 98,771, up 4,399 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizeable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.\nOperating income was $8.2 billion, up 7% versus last year, for an operating margin of 21%. Other Income & Expense was $1.9 billion, which includes $1.3 billion of unrealized gain related to a non-marketable debt security investment. We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $12.77.\nTurning now to Capex and Operating Cash Flow. Cash Capex for the quarter was $7.1 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating Cash Flow was $13.0 billion with Free Cash Flow of $5.9 billion. We ended the quarter with Cash & Marketable Securities of approximately $109 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results.\nStarting with the Google segment: Revenues were $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27.0 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager. Other revenues for Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $7.4 billion, or 23% of total advertising revenues, and up 15% 2 year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was down year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites. The increase in the Sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile which carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements, offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter. In Q4, the Network TAC rate declined year-on-year, primarily due to a revenue mix shift within our programmatic business.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totalled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.7 billion, up 13% versus last year, and the operating margin was 24.8%. Accrued Capex for the quarter was $6.8 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities, data centers and servers.\nLet me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. I\u2019ll cover results for the full year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for Other Bets over a longer term horizon, as we have discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release. For the full year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595 million, up 25% vs. 2017, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was $3.4 billion for the full year 2018, versus an operating loss of $2.7 billion in 2017. Other Bets Accrued Capex was $181 million, down from $493 million in 2017, primarily reflecting investments in Fiber.\nKey recent accomplishments include: In December, Waymo launched \u201cWaymo One,\u201d which enables participants to use its app to hail and pay for rides. Also Verily recently announced a $1 billion investment round, led by Silver Lake, as it advances on plans that are complementary and additive to its current life sciences portfolio. That investment of course was in addition to the $800 million it raised from Temasek previously.\nLet me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook. First, with respect to Revenues. Our 23% Revenue growth in 2018 was powered in particular by the ongoing benefit of innovation in our Sites business. With eight products with more than one billion users each, and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe. In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine learning capabilities across our businesses. In our advertising business, machine learning has enabled innovation in advertisers\u2019 ability to match consumer intent and to bid more effectively for improved ROI. It has also enhanced the ability of smaller businesses to benefit from advertising on our platforms. Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses like Cloud and Hardware, as well as central to a number of Other Bets, most notably Waymo and Verily.\nLooking ahead, a couple of things to note: first, as we\u2019ve said many times, we continuously work to enhance the user and advertiser experience. Because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly in search advertising, can vary, which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth. Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turned to headwinds in the third and fourth quarters, in line with the strengthening of the US dollar. Based on the continuing strengthening of the US dollar, we expect a headwind to reported versus fixed FX results in the first quarter, in contrast to the favorable impact of FX in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nTurning to investments and profitability. In terms of gross margin, the biggest component within Cost of Revenues remains our Traffic Acquisition Costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites Revenues slowed after the first quarter of 2018, we do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search.\nWithin Opex, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize resources for longer-term growth in sizable markets. You\u2019ll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D, although we expect the growth rate to moderate in 2019. In 2018, we also saw continued progress on our goal to nurture new businesses outside of Google -- our Other Bets -- with a model of independence.\nWhile I\u2019ve said previously that there is no monolithic approach to how the Other Bets execute against opportunities, a shared principle is aligning employee interests with the long-term value creation by these companies. Since inception, this has been an important part of our approach at Google, with stock grants comprising a meaningful component of overall compensation across our employee base. We\u2019re increasingly following that approach in the Other Bets, with compensation programs that align employee and company interests. You\u2019ve seen the impact of some of those programs in the fourth quarter as we accrued compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. While these expenses will recur, the timing of valuation events is unpredictable and can vary between Bets, which can affect quarterly comparisons.\nFinally, on capital allocation our primary use continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions. After taking these needs into account, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $12.5 billion of our Class C Capital Stock. With respect to Capex, we continue to invest in both compute requirements and for office facilities, although we expect the capex growth rate in 2019 to moderate quite significantly.\nIn conclusion, 2018 was another great year, with tremendous ongoing opportunity ahead of us. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Ruth. Last year, we set out to bring the benefits of AI to everyone through our products, and I\u2019m proud of the tremendous progress we made towards that goal. From Smart Compose in Gmail, to the new Google News experience, to Call Screening on the Pixel, and improving the overall safety of our products, AI is helping people get things done every day.\nBeyond our products, AI is also helping us drive our mission forward at a scale we couldn\u2019t have imagined just a few years ago. Google AI lead Jeff Dean recapped the results of our efforts in a great post on our AI blog -- like using AI to better detect the spread of breast cancer or providing flood victims with real-time information in a crisis. I encourage everyone to check it out.\nWe also launched the Google AI Impact Challenge to help nonprofits find ways to use AI to solve social and environmental problems. In addition to our progress in AI, we saw great traction across newer areas like the Google Assistant, Hardware and Cloud. And our core areas such as Search, Maps, News, YouTube and our computing and advertising platforms continued their strong momentum.\nEverything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the Internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge. And one that is constantly getting harder.\nBut we have twenty years of experience in these information challenges and it's what we strive to do better than anyone else. As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping users' data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems, and giving people better and clearer controls. You will see us continue to do a lot more here in 2019.\nToday, I\u2019ll start by sharing some of the new ways that we\u2019re working toward our mission. Then, I\u2019ll give an update on our video and advertising platforms, followed by the latest on our Hardware and Cloud efforts. And I\u2019ll close with a few thoughts on our investments around the world.\nFirst, advancing our mission of making information accessible and useful. The Google Assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout their day, and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features.\nFrom the Lenovo smart clock that wakes you up in the morning...to real-time navigation that helps during your commute...to a built-in interpreter that translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google Home.\nAnd speaking of languages, over the last year, the Google Assistant expanded from 8 languages and 14 countries to nearly 30 languages and 80 countries. In that time, the number of active users has quadrupled. As we add more partners, devices and capabilities, the Google Assistant will only get better and more helpful.\nThere\u2019s a lot of great progress in other areas too. Last month, we announced the launch of activity cards in Search. Now, when you search for a topic that you\u2019ve previously explored, you can quickly see where you\u2019ve already been and pick up where you left off. Thanks to our strengths in AI and Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than one billion products. So if you see an item that you like, Lens can show you similar designs, along with useful information like product reviews.\nWe continued to see great momentum across our computing platforms, Android and Chrome. In Q4, we announced that Android will officially support foldable phones, with partners like Samsung introducing their first foldable devices this year. We see continued traction with manufacturer adoption of Android Auto. We recently announced new media and messaging features to significantly simplify and improve the car dashboard experience. And building on the speed, simplicity and security of ChromeOS, partners like ASUS and HP introduced a slew of great new consumer and enterprise Chromebooks last month at CES.\nNow, let me provide an update on our video and advertising platforms, starting with YouTube. We\u2019re seeing great traction in some of our newer experiences on YouTube. YouTube Music and\n\nYouTube Premium are now available in nearly 30 countries, up from 5 countries at the start of 2018. Last month, YouTube TV announced that it has expanded nationwide to cover 98% of U.S. households, with the rest to follow shortly. YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly two billion monthly logged in users. For instance, in Q4 we expanded access to tools like Stories and Community posts that strengthen the connections between fans and creators.\nOne of our newest tools -- Premieres -- is a breakout hit. Ariana Grande's Premiere of her official music video for \"thank you, next\" in November holds the record for biggest music video debut in YouTube history, earning over 55 million views in its first day. We\u2019re driving revenue to the YouTube creator community -- from established channels to newly emerging ones.\nThe number of YouTube channels with more than one million subscribers nearly doubled in the last year, and the number of creators earning five or six figures grew by more than 40% year-over-year.\nA big priority for YouTube in 2019 is to continue our work to quickly find and remove content that violates YouTube\u2019s Content Guidelines. It\u2019s an important challenge, and with advanced machine learning and investments in human reviewers, we are making continued progress.\nNow I\u2019ll touch on some of the recent highlights of our advertising business, which continued to go from strength to strength.\nRecently, Warner Brothers embedded the first full-length film within an ad on YouTube and reached a record number of people -- over 17 million users in a single day! Viewers who watched the trailer for Lego Movie 2 on Black Friday were served the franchise\u2019s original film for free within the ad. It\u2019s a great example of how advertisers continue to delight users on YouTube.\nPerformance advertisers love TrueView for Action, YouTube's direct response offering.\nSince the product launched in March 2018, over 30% of the advertisers who used TrueView for Action were new to buying video ads on YouTube.\nIn Q4, we also announced a global strategic adtech relationship with The Walt Disney Company across their entire portfolio of brands and properties. With Google Ad Manager as its core platform, Disney will be able to serve across its digital properties seamlessly -- on the web, in mobile apps, through connected TVs, and even during live events.\nOur shopping tools were also front and center during the holidays, helping retailers reach people during the busy holiday shopping season. In fact, the number of shopping daily active users on Google.com during the holidays doubled compared to last year, thanks in part to new features like product list modules that showcase the most popular products across the web. Small retailers are also benefiting from automated bidding solutions like Smart Shopping Campaigns, which now has more than 20,000 live merchants - impressive progress since launching in April.\nNow onto our growing Hardware efforts.\nDuring the holiday season, our newest lineup of Made by Google devices topped many \u201cBest of 2018\u201d lists. The response from shoppers was equally positive. It was another record year for\n\nour Google Home family of devices, with millions sold this holiday season. They\u2019re helping people easily get things done around the house. For example, people used Google Home devices to cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season -- one million on Christmas day alone. Our newest smart displays were particularly popular. One out of every seven Google Home devices activated over the holiday season was a Google Home Hub. In Q4, we launched significant advances in computational photography in our Pixel 3, with features such as Night Sight for low-light photos. We also expanded availability to four more countries: Japan, France, Ireland and Taiwan.\nAnd finally, our growing Cloud business.\nI want to thank Diane Greene for her leadership over the last three years. Google Cloud is a fast-growing multi-billion dollar business that supports major Global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization. This was not the case just 3 years ago.\nWhat Diane and her team accomplished is phenomenal. Now, Diane\u2019s work is done and she has handed the reins to Thomas Kurian, and I am thrilled to have him here as our new Cloud leader.\nGoogle Cloud closed out the year strong, with momentum across the business. Last year, we more than doubled both the number of Google Cloud Platform deals over $1 million, as well as the number of multi-year contracts signed. We also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million paying customers for our Cloud collaboration and productivity solution, G Suite. Our focus on helping customers digitally transform their businesses is paying off.\nWe continued to see strong growth in all of our major geographies and industries this quarter.\nIn Financial Services, we signed agreements with 2 of the top financial institutions in the U.S. to help them transition their business to Google Cloud with our highly secure solutions. In Retail, brands like Bed, Bath & Beyond, DSW, and Ulta Beauty are using our cloud to manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumers. In Media & Entertainment, The Telegraph in the UK is going all in with Google Cloud because of our data and machine learning expertise.\nTo support our global growth, in Q4 we launched our 18th Google Cloud region, and announced plans for a new region in Jakarta.\nSo as you can see, we are investing in the many incredible opportunities across our business. We\u2019re also investing in communities around the world, and right here at home.\nI was recently in Europe opening up our new office in Berlin, which will help us more than double the number of Googlers who work there. Across Europe, we have invested more than \u20ac4.3 billion in five data centers since 2007 -- and in Q4, we announced a new data center coming in Denmark. In all, it is estimated that these data centers have generated more than \u20ac5.4 billion in GDP over the last decade. Of course, the amount generated by our creator, publisher and app developer partners across the region, is orders of magnitude larger.\nWe also continue our substantial investments throughout the U.S. Last year, we made significant investments in new and expanded office space. In Q4, we opened the doors to our new office in Detroit and announced that we\u2019ll be investing over $1 billion in capital improvements to establish a new campus in New York City, which will begin to open in 2020.\nWe\u2019re also continuing to invest in data center construction and expansion. This is an important long-term investment that will lay the groundwork for our future computing needs, primarily to accelerate machine learning across our businesses, but also to support the opportunities we see in Cloud, Search, Ads and YouTube.\nMore than twenty years in, there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses, and build stronger communities.\nI want to thank every Googler around the world for making 2018 a great year for users and our business.\nWith that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on the phone lines, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star and then the number 1 key on your touch-one telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we do ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks so much for taking the question. Two, if I could. Sundar, on YouTube, you now have a number of brands in the marketplace between YouTube Premium, TV, YouTube Music. How are you thinking about positioning those brands against the global opportunity, especially in mobile, to consume media on a global scale and how you're positioning those brands for the opportunity. And then, Ruth, wanted to come back to a comment on revenue versus expense with respect to YouTube. It sounds like you called out YouTube as strong in the quarter on the revenue side but as a depressant on the expense side. Was that because of licensed content for things like music and YouTube TV? Was it ad splits? How should we think about what the drivers were there and how they're permanent versus seasonal in Q4? Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Eric. On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around the main YouTube product. And that is what, you know, works at scale globally across the world. And we are seeing continued engagement. And it's doing very well. We are committed to making sure there is a premium experience on YouTube delivering the content people would want. And YouTube Music is an important part of that as well. So we are investing in both.\nAs you know, YouTube TV is U.S. only. And, you know, we are definitely - it's an exciting product. It's differentiated and has longer run value for us, because it brings our advertising products together, including being able to serve it across TV.\nSo, you know, we are clearly investing in areas where we see opportunity. We are pretty thorough about making sure our investments deliver growth on the other side. And so we monitor it with metrics and, be it engagement and revenue growth, and we see a lot of opportunity here.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of revenue and investments in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change in the way users are consuming content and that's reflected in strong revenue growth. Brand advertising does remain the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace. And as I said in opening comments, we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response, both TrueView for Action and app promo formats are delivering great value for users and advertisers. And that's driving growth across regions and channels.\nIn terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within Other Cost of Revenues, you know, the primary driver in the fourth quarter was the increase in content acquisition costs due to YouTube growth. And that's both for ad supported content in what is typically a seasonally strong quarter, and also for our newer subscription businesses, which do have higher CAC as a percentage of revenue. We're excited about the growth we're seeing here.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, if I look at the segment operating losses for Other Bets, they were higher both in the fourth quarter and for the year, '18 over '17. Is it safe to assume that\u2019s investments at Waymo, or can you just flesh out a little bit more for us, if possible, were there other Other Bets besides Waymo, which were worthy of callout in terms of greater or decreasing investment? That would be great. And then for Sundar, I'm just wondering if you can provide us any commentary about how growth at Cloud is going, any milestones. Talked about the investment there, Ruth did, I think, in terms of headcount growth and technical and sales roles. And for the new leadership that you mentioned, what are the things that Thomas Kurian can kind of do at Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth in that business? Thank you so much.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of the investment levels in Other Bets, you know, the major point is that we're investing across Other Bets commensurate with what we think is required -- kind of looking out at the opportunity set for each one. And we go through a regular process with weekly business reviews and quarterly board reviews and try and calibrate the appropriate pace of investment. In terms of the increase this quarter, as I indicated in opening comments, we accrued some comp expenses for a number of Bets. And that was really to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On Cloud, you know, one of the things that, you know, was evident towards the end of last year is now our ability to win, you know, very large customers, Global 5,000 companies with multi-year contracts. And so that's definitely something we want to focus on.\nYou know, I think Diane and Thomas have been working closely on a transition with a lot of continuity, and you'll continue to see us, it's very clear to us that our product offerings are ready and differentiated. And, you know, so we want to invest and scale our go-to-market both in terms of direct sales and our channel partnerships. And maybe you will see us focus more on , on the areas where we are clearly seeing returns, be it the geographic regions. We care about the six main verticals, where most of the momentum is, and within our product offerings, the five major areas where we have clearly defined product with differentiated features, too. But I am excited at the traction we are seeing. We are getting large wins. And, you know, look forward to executing here.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask two. First, when you think about the strong Google Sites growth, 23% FX neutral, can you just help us understand some of the mobile Search innovations that you think are really driving things here beyond some of the just underlying secular strength, and with a particular focus perhaps on the retail channel and just how you're thinking about the opportunity there. And then second, Ruth, just wanted to go back to your comment on opex. Just wanted to clarify. Were you saying that headcount growth specifically you think will moderate in '19, or are you talking about overall opex spending? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Doug, on the first one, you know, obviously, we have, you know, thousands of engineers working on continually launching Search improvements. I think for me, a lot of this has been, you know, the clear hard work that's gone into making sure Search on mobile works really, really well, removing friction where we can, constantly working to get the answers a bit quicker and faster, and making them more relevant. So to me, it's more, you know, a sort of continual innovation mentality that we have had there for a long time. And, you know, that's really working at scale.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then the specific comment I think you're referencing is, I was pointing to headcount growth. We are continuing to hire to support growth opportunities, particularly hiring engineers and product managers in Google and continuing to support growth in Cloud. And what I was just trying to draw out was, we will continue to hire, but the year on year growth rate will moderate there.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Okay. Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you. Yeah. I had a follow up to Anthony's questions on Cloud. It doesn't seem like you want to share an update on the revenue run rate. But I was wondering if maybe you could share with us what you're seeing in terms of year over year growth rates. And in particular are they growing faster than what the competitors disclose in their public results? Because maybe that will help think about the pace of growth in your Cloud business. And then secondarily, I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the types of workloads, if there's any commonality to the types of workloads that you might be running more frequently than not. Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue growth driven by GCP, and GCP does remain one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet. As Sundar said, we've doubled the number of GCP contracts greater than a million. We're also seeing a really nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million, and really pleased with the success and penetration there. At this point not updating further.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And, Heather, you know, I think, maybe specifically a couple of examples, there's definitely - you know, we see clear strength in data management and analytics. So we can take, for example, in retail, or if you take someone like The Telegraph, you know, those are important factors. You know, application platform, so our ability to help customers deploy cloud native applications has been a differentiator, customers like Unity, Ubisoft, et cetera. And, you know, multi-cloud, the ability to run Cloud services across clouds, on prem turns out to be very important for global, multinational companies like HSBC.\nSo, you know, we do see a wide variety of stuff. We are clearly focused on infrastructure, being an application platform, data management and smart analytics, and, of course, with GSuite, productivity and collaboration. So that's the core areas we are investing in from a product and a go to market standpoint. And, you know, we are seeing great traction there.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one, to go back to YouTube. You had a very strong quarter, it sounds like, on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads. I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here? And then on Waymo, got a couple milestones throughout the last three to six months. Maybe talk us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really focused on, ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on YouTube, I still think we are in early days of making sure YouTube is, you know, a better platform for direct response. And TrueView for Action is still -- it's still early. We see great traction, but I think there's a lot more to do. And I think we have a set of features which we launched last year to make sure it works better. But I think there's a lot more to do. Long run, I think for me, you know, YouTube is a place where we see users not only come for entertainment. They come to find information. They're coming to learn about things. They're coming to discover, to research. And so being able to match that intent over time in a way that we can bring the right value for our users and advertisers, I think, is a long run opportunity. And, you know, we are taking all the right foundational steps to realize it.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of Waymo, as you know well, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And that's why we're expanding methodically. We are pleased that we've continued to broaden out our service in the Phoenix area. And we're focused on expanding both the number of riders and the geographic reach around Phoenix. In addition, we're having conversations with a number of other interested cities. And we are continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities. So continuing to execute as we've described previously.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thanks. Two questions. First, Ruth, could you just provide a little more color on the R&D expense buildup? Anything unusual in there? Just comment on the cadence of that. And then, Sundar, on Hardware, it's been a mult-iyear effort. It seems it's accelerated. There's a series of these new products -- we tried to do a report on them to make sure we understood them. Could you talk about how the strategic and maybe the synergistic impacts that you\u2019re seeing of Hardware on the rest of Google's business, on the rest of Alphabet's business, and do you think that's still early days and maybe paint a picture of how significant those synergies could be. Thank you very much.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So starting with R&D, the main driver is our ongoing investment in engineers, in particular, in Google, and then, as I said, the sizable increase in accrued comp for Other Bets. And just to build that out a bit more, give you a bit more color, in certain Other Bets, employees are compensated through equity based programs. And that's because we believe that this alignment of interests is valuable. We do assess valuation on an ongoing basis. And at a minimum, we do a formal valuation assessment once every 12 months or when there's a significant event. And what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is the impact of higher valuation in certain Other Bets. And you know as we've talked about previously, a goal with the Alphabet structure is to enable us to build new businesses that would make a positive impact and create long term value. And it's still early days. We're very excited about the opportunities we see. And so what you're seeing is, you know, the impact here of valuation. The way we approach it is very consistent with the way startups are typically valued, and that includes technical progress and a range of other items.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And, Mark, on Hardware, you know, obviously, you know, we are working hard to offer the best Google experience we can, you know, bringing together AI software and hardware. And you are right that it does have a lot of synergistic value. But at the stage where we are in, the main way we do that today for our core products is by using hardware to drive where the rest of the computing ecosystem is. And so we get a very leveraged effect there. But over time, as we scale up our Hardware efforts and do it thoughtfully so, it definitely, you know, when I look at the kind of experience we can deliver, for example, if you look at something like the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, Assistant and YouTube and Photos when you want it, you know, you can definitely see the glimpse of the future, and so, you know, we are investing to realize that.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Okay. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit\nSuisse. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Okay. Sundar, just picking up on the AI for everyone theme you've been highlighting at I/O as well as other venues. Our conversations with advertisers suggest that products like Smart Bidding are becoming a pretty increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding strategies. But, you know, how has the pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do you think you can target that market without a sales force? And secondarily, as we talk to companies transitioning to the cloud, there's increased talk of collecting data, dealing with data leaks, as well as analyzing all that data to help their decision making process. So from your standpoint, running Google, do you feel like the current technology you have at your disposal is sophisticated enough to keep up with all of the needs for you to run the company as you collect all the data from across the Internet? Okay thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: I think two questions. On your first question around, you know, you know, using machine learning to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer advertisers, SMBs and local advertisers. You know, I definitely think you highlight, you know, an exciting opportunity. Whenever we have done work like, you know, be it last year or the last couple of years, through Universal App Campaigns or Smart Shopping Campaigns, last year, responsive Search ads, those are all great examples of where we brought ML. And with that, we made the process much easier for advertisers of all sizes and we see an impact. So I think it's a natural extension for us to continue working in that direction. And that will help us reach SMBs and local advertisers better over time. So I do think that's a good opportunity.\nAnd on the second part of your question, I want to make sure I understand it. You know, if you're asking about how we invest in our security as a company, I think it's a foundation of how we do everything for the past 20 years. And, you know, we always -- we realize the deep responsibility that comes with being stewards of users' data. So everything we design is designed with privacy and security in mind. It's where, you know, some of our core investments go, be it securing our data centers, you know, literally, the practices we have across the company, the quality and talent in our security teams, and over time, using AI itself to do all this well. So it's a core part of what we do. And, you know, we take it very, very seriously.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO Capital): All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in your review of some of the shopping products during the fourth quarter, you didn't mention Shopping Actions, and there were reports there that Walmart decided to leave the program recently. And I think there have been some public comments on social media from Googlers confirming that. So just love to hear a little bit more about that, but maybe more broadly, the traction of Shopping Actions, and in particular the price per sale metric that you rolled out with it during the holiday season. And then, Ruth, just a quick one for you, if we could return to your prepared remarks. There were a couple of sort of things to keep in mind that you were highlighting. One was FX going from a tailwind to a headwind. But just before that, you were talking about how new experiences can roll out over time to users. And I just wanted to clarify, were you referencing an experience that's rolling out currently or just generally that that is a best practice in general for Google? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on Shopping, you know, I think we launched Shopping Actions around, if I remember, March of last year. And, you know, we have definitely seen a strong traction there. I think we have seen roughly a sevenfold increase in merchants in the program since we launched it. And just in Q4, we announced new partnerships with Best Buy, Nike, Sephora as an example. And, you know, in terms of Walmart, we have - Walmart is one of our deepest partners. And they remain a strategic partner across multiple businesses for us, including Google ads. And we have efforts underway to work closer together with Shopping. But, you know, they are -- they're definitely a large partner who continue experimenting, and we'll support them in many ways. But I think, overall, I'm excited about the efforts we are doing in Shopping. And you will see us, you know, focus more there on 2019. We see users come to Google a lot around key shopping moments. And we want to make sure we invest in that experience to get closer to what they want.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then on the second question, we've talked about this on prior calls, we've often talked about the fact that we have been and remain committed to long term revenue growth through innovation. And the point I was trying to underscore is the timing and scale of the impact is inherently difficult to predict and so can be inconsistent from quarter to quarter. The main point is, we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and advertisers, in particular, building off of Sundar's comment as we apply machine learning to solutions.\nDan Salmon (BMO Capital): Great. Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of\nRobert Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (RW Baird): Great. Thank you, two quick ones for me. First, on Project Stream and YouTube TV. Just wondering how important it\u2019ll be to invest in original content as well as how you might view the rollout of 5G as catalyzing consumer adoption of these services. And then on the Discover feed, I know that's still pretty new, but curious if you had any color on usage and engagement to date and if there's any way you expect to monetize that feed in the near future. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on Project Stream, you know, being able to, you know, deliver gaming with the kind of, you know, real time requirements, the low latency requirements, it's definitely for us -- you know, it's an important computing advance. We think it'll help us drive, you know, the newer computing platforms we are working on. And I do think, you know, services like that will be a point of inflection as 5G rolls out as well. So I think, you know, it is a virtuous cycle.\nSo we are excited at the early feedback on our Project Stream experience has been super positive. And so we are looking to build upon that. And, you know, you will see us do more there in 2019.\nOn Discover, you know, I think, you know, traction has been -- for us, we measure user engagement and satisfaction and happiness on these, on anything new we do. And the metrics have been, you know, really strong. And we obviously, you know, we offer the best experience today on our products like Pixel, Made by Google products. And we are looking to scale that up to reach more users. But we think we have a strong product there. And, you know, I think it's very synergistic to the Search experience. So we're looking to bring the best of both to our users. And you'll see us reach more users in 2019.\nColin Sebastian (RW Baird): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of\nAmerica, Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Great, thank you. A couple questions. First, it looks like Google core margins were down about three points in what was an easier comp. So just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on how the core advertising business is doing in there? We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and Hardware and YouTube TV. But just would like to get an update on the health of the advertising business margins and any thoughts on if you'll ever do segment disclosure? And then the second question is, just on the Cloud strategy, there's been a pretty big leadership change. Just wondering if there's any new strategies or new things you'll be doing this year with the Cloud related to the management change. And look forward to the Cloud conference in April. Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thanks. So in terms of overall Google margins, I think the main point you're seeing in the margins is we continue to see tremendous opportunity across Google. And so we're investing to support long term revenue and earnings growth. We've talked a lot on this call already about the importance of machine learning. And it is a key component of incremental investment, you know, particularly in capex for our technical infrastructure to support the existing -- existing businesses, but also the newer ones. And that's kind of flowing through here. We've talked on prior calls that we're very mindful of the fact that capex turns into depreciation, which is why, you know, I single this out. We're continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the Ads business, Search and Ads businesses. And beyond machine learning, we're further investing to continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's across Mobile, Desktop and YouTube.\nSo, for example, a big priority in 2018 was expanding the availability of content for what we called the Next Billion User markets, which are, for us, you know, a really important area. We're excited about the growth and the opportunity to deliver experiences across markets.\nWe're also investing to enable more visual ways of finding information, such as you know, photos and videos, and then we're investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly Cloud and Hardware, as Sundar has already said.\nSo what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the cost of revenues side is the impact of the product mix that we\u2019ve talked about. A big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube. And then on the opex side, investing in engineers, in particular for Google, as well as on the sales and marketing side, you know, the increased headcount to support not just Ads, but in particular Cloud.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And on the second question, on Cloud, you know, I answered it around Anthony and Heather's question. But to add a little bit more color, you know, why -- maybe it's, you know, the change in leadership. But it was a well planned transition, and so Diane and Thomas together planned 2019.\nAnd, you know, the big things you're going to see are, you know, a continued focus on Global 5,000 companies. We are definitely seeing traction with large multi-year contracts, multi-million dollar contracts there. So you'll see us focus there. We'll continue to invest in and expand our sales and distribution channels to meet customer demand. So that's going to be an important area for 2019. But mostly being highly focused on the 15 countries, six industries and the five major solution areas that we think will have the most impact, and directing most of our resources towards those efforts is probably something you will see continued emphasis in 2019.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of\nBarclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Great. Two questions. First, there's a lot of discussion right now about alternatives to Google Play and Apple's App Store for distribution. And some of the large developers are starting to come up with these workarounds around the App Store fee. So I guess, just philosophically, how do you think about the 30%? Do you think that's the right long term rate for Google Play? And then, Ruth, coming back to the headcount and capex growth moderating comments, so you had expenses growing well in excess of revenue for some time in the core Google segment, and 2018 was the lowest operating income growth since you started disclosing the segments. So are you just flagging this as a change in direction? Is this a material change? Or is this just a small amount of moderation in 2019? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on Google Play, you know, obviously, we do this at scale. Thousands of developers rely on it to safely and seamlessly distribute their game to billions of Android users worldwide. And, you know, we invest a lot in our infrastructure to continuously make sure the overall experience is safe and results in high engagement for the developers back. So I think there's a value exchange there, and it's been the industry standard. And so, you know, I think we'll continue down that path, and you know but, obviously, always adapt to where the market is.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of the pace of investment, you know, I've already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. And just wanted to put a fine point on both capex and headcount. So on capex, as I indicated in opening remarks, we do expect the rate of year-on-year capex growth will slow meaningfully. So, you know, with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does require capex. We are committed to continue to invest in capex to deliver on that.\nIn terms of the mix, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers. But the point which you asked in your question, the year-on-year growth rate will moderate meaningfully.\nAnd then in terms of headcount, you know, we're -- I was just trying to make clear that the growth in headcount will moderate somewhat here, just so that there's no interpolation.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks. For Sundar, the cash position has doubled the last five years to $109 billion. Yet in the last four years, M&A has been right around $3 billion, which is, you know, well below your peers. And I'm just curious, it seems like the core is very strong, but is there any hesitation that you're seeing in terms of valuation or other factors that are playing into that relative to what your peers are doing right now?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, I think -- you know, we have always approached M&A as, you know, I think -- I think really, you know, we are always evaluating opportunities. We have a very high bar. And so, to me, it's been more about, you know, us finding the right fit rather than being constrained by anything in particular.\nBut, you know, I do think it's always an important part of our strategy. And we have done great acquisitions in the past. You know, things like YouTube and Android were big acquisitions for us. And so we continue to look for opportunities ahead.\nBrent Thill (Barclays): And real quick for Ruth, just the magnitude of spend, I think, goes back to what probably investors were most surprised by. It sounds like from your perspective, you don't really look at the margin structure as having any floor. You're just looking at this as, as you said, this tremendous long term opportunity that you need to make these investments now. I think many are just trying to search for a framework and how you think about this investment cycle we're in right now.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So the reason I started by laying out, I think, a response to the question on margins, where we're investing and how we look at it is, we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We're very mindful of the capex impact on free cash flow and earnings growth. And so we're trying to get it right. You know, overinvesting, underinvesting, neither of those works for long-term value creation. But we are very mindful of the pace here and trying to lay out with more specificity how we're looking at the opportunity set where -- and making tradeoffs where we can.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for\ntoday. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing comments.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2019 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.\n", "20191": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the \u200bQ1 2019 Earnings Call webcast\u200b.\nAlphabet Q1 2019 Earnings Call April 29, 2019\nCandice (Operator): \u200bGood day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet first quarter 2019 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star and then zero on your touch-tone telephone. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: \u200bThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s first-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Thank you, Ellen. In the first quarter, Total Revenues of $36.3 billion, were up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency, following a strong 2018. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, along with important contributions from YouTube, followed by Cloud.\nFor today\u2019s call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.\nLet me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $36.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $1.2 billion, or $1.0 billion after the impact of our hedging program. With respect to Alphabet revenues by geography, US revenues were $16.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year, and up 16% in constant currency, reflectingweakeningoftheEuroandtheBritishpound.\u200bA\u200b PACrevenueswere$6.1billion,up 27% versus last year, and up 31% in constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakness of the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee. Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and up 21% in constant currency reflecting primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real and Argentine peso.\nTurning to profitability, in our earnings press release we provide a table to highlight the impact of the European Commission fine on Operating Income, Net Income and EPS results in the first\n\n quarter. I will comment on results both with and without the impact of the fine as I review the results.\nOn a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment results, was $16.0 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $9.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; followed by Content acquisition costs - primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising-supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues.\nOperating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $13.7 billion. Excluding the impact of the fine, operating expenses were $12.0 billion, up 20% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses, with headcount growth in Cloud as the largest driver. Growth in Sales and Marketing expenses primarily reflects additions to headcount. Growth in G&A expenses is primarily due to legal matters, including the effect of a legal settlement gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Stock-based compensation totalled $2.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 103,459, up 4,688 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizeable headcount increases were in Cloud, for both technical and sales roles.\nOperating income was $6.6 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating income was $8.3 billion, up 9% versus last year, for an operating margin of 23%. Other Income & Expense was $1.5 billion. As I trust most of you are aware, in 2018 this line item was meaningfully elevated because of the introduction of a new accounting standard that requires recognition of unrealized gains and losses on equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.\nOur effective tax rate was 18.3% for the first quarter, reflecting a sizable impact from the non-deductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.50. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.90.\nTurning now to Capex and operating cash flow.\nCash Capex for the quarter was $4.6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating Cash Flow was $12.0 billion with Free Cash Flow of $7.4 billion. We ended the quarter with Cash and Marketable Securities of approximately $113 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results.\nStarting with the Google segment, Revenues were $36.2 billion, up 17% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $25.7 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.0 billion, up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth, AdMob, followed by Google Ad Manager.\n\n Other revenues for Google were $5.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud and Play and partially offset by Hardware. Google Cloud Platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet, with strong customer momentum, reflected in particular in demand for our compute and data analytics products. Strong growth in Play was driven particularly by performance in APAC. Hardware results reflect lower year-on-year sales of Pixel, reflecting in part heavy promotional activity industry-wide given some of the recent pressures in the premium smartphone market.\nWe provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.9 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 9% year-over-year. \u200bTotal\u200b TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, as well as a decrease in the Network TAC rate. The Sites TAC rate was flat year-over-year, as the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, was offset by the growth in TAC-free Sites revenues, primarily from YouTube. In Q1, the Network TAC rate declined year on year, primarily due to a favorable product mix shift.\nGoogle stock-based compensation totalled $2.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.3 billion, up 11% versus last year, and the operating margin was 25.8%. Accrued Capex for the quarter was $4.5 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, servers and office facilities.\nLet me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $170 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $868 million. Other Bets Accrued Capex was $59 million. Key recent accomplishments include Waymo recently announced that it will expand its activities in Michigan, opening a facility in Detroit that will be the first factory dedicated to the production of L4 autonomous vehicles. Last week, there were exciting announcements from two additional Other Bets that were originally incubated within X. Loon announced a long-term strategic relationship to advance the use of high altitude vehicles to deliver connectivity, with SoftBank\u2019s telecoms group, HAPSMobile, which will invest $125 million in Loon. Wing became the first drone delivery company to receive air carrier certification from the FAA, an important step toward beginning a commercial service delivering goods from local businesses to homes in the U.S.\nLet me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook. As we highlighted on our last call, there was a significant swing year over year in the impact of currency movements on our results this quarter, from a big tailwind in the first quarter of 2018 to a headwind in 2019. These affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the US. Based on the continued strengthening of the US dollar relative to key currencies, we expect a continued headwind to our revenues and operating income again in the second quarter.\nIn terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to Sites Revenues, as we indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can have an impact on year-on-year growth rates. We will continue to make changes with a focus on the long-term best interest of users and advertisers. We remain confident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the\n\n advertiser and user experience through our ongoing commitment to product innovation, in particular by leveraging Machine Learning across our ads products and properties.\nTurning to the key drivers of growth in Other Revenues, we are pleased with the momentum of Google Cloud Platform, with balanced growth of both new customers and expansion within existing customers driving revenue growth. With respect to Hardware results, while the first quarter results reflect pressures in the premium smartphone industry, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum for Assistant-enabled Home devices, particularly the Home Hub and Mini devices and look forward to our May 7 announcement at I/O from the Hardware team.\nTurning to profitability. With regard to Google Opex, the first quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term. You can see that in R&D, where we continue to invest in technical talent for priority areas like Cloud, Search and Machine Learning. In terms of Sales and Marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a timing shift in spend, and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second quarter. In Other Bets Opex, we are still early in the life of these companies and do plan to continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity.\nWith respect to Capex, the year-on-year decline reflects the purchase of a building in New York in the first quarter of 2018. As discussed on our call last quarter, while we anticipate that our full year CapEx investments will exceed those in 2018, the growth in investments should be at a meaningfully lower rate than in 2018. We continue to expect a sizable investment in both compute requirements to support long term growth, as well as in office facilities.\nIn conclusion, we feel confident about the opportunities ahead and we continue to invest thoughtfully for the long term.\nI will now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Thanks, Ruth. It\u2019s great to be here with you all. Q1 was a very busy quarter at Google, and it\u2019s only going to get busier. Later this week, we\u2019ll host YouTube\u2019s upfronts event, Brandcast, followed by our annual developer conference, Google I/O next week, and our advertising summit Google Marketing Live later in the month. You\u2019ll hear a lot more from each of these teams throughout May, so I hope you can join us.\nWe have always been a company that has focused on the long term, willing to make investments that will help our businesses -- and our customers\u2019 businesses -- succeed as technology continues to evolve. You saw this in the transition to mobile computing years ago, and we\u2019re seeing that today in the shift to AI. We feel very positive about the enormous opportunities ahead, in evolving search and assistant, capturing new ad budgets, cloud computing, AI, and other areas.\nWhat gives us these opportunities is Google\u2019s position to help people, businesses, and society in countless ways through our products.\nToday, I\u2019ll start by talking about our core mission of making information universally accessible and useful. Then I\u2019ll provide an update on our computing, video and advertising platforms. And finally, I\u2019ll discuss our hardware and Cloud efforts.\n\n First, an update on how our mission to make information accessible and useful is helping people every day. A big focus for us is building products that are designed to help people in their day to day lives. Our Duplex technology within Google Assistant can now help you easily book a table at your favorite restaurant on all Android and iOS devices in 44 U.S. states. Just tell the Assistant where you want to go and when, and it will do the rest.\nWe\u2019ve also begun testing AR walking navigation in Google Maps, which uses augmented reality and your phone\u2019s camera to show you where you are relative to the surroundings as you\u2019re walking. Just last week, we announced an improved job search experience in the U.S. that helps people easily discover quality remote jobs, allowing them to work right from home. As part of our Google News Initiative, we kicked off the Local Experiments Project, working with local publishers to uncover new approaches to their business models and operations so they can continue bringing great local content to their readers.\nAI is now spurring a new era of computing -- which is more predictive and more assistive. We\u2019re committed to doing deep research and working to advance this space in a responsible way. AI is deeply embedded in our products -- from Search to Photos to Google Home -- and we\u2019re also expanding others\u2019 ability to build on our advancements. Recently at TensorFlow\u2019s annual Developer Summit, we announced TensorFlow 2.0, making it easier than ever to build and use ML through improvements like TensorFlow Privacy, which helps train models with differential privacy -- meaning that users\u2019 data is better protected.\nNow onto our computing, video and advertising platforms.\nThere\u2019s tremendous momentum across the Android ecosystem and our other computing platforms as we head into Google I/O. In the first quarter, we released the beta of Android Q, which brings added privacy protections, new tools for developers to engage users, and more. Android Go edition, an optimized version of Android tailored for smartphones with 1GB or less, delivers a powerful, fast and secure experience specifically optimized for entry-level smartphones. Today, roughly 70% of entry-level Android devices are now activating with Go, like Samsung's J2 Core.\nWe\u2019re seeing great momentum in Android Auto as well. At the Chicago Auto Show, Toyota announced that it will include Android Auto in upcoming vehicles, starting in 2020. That means all of the top 10 car makers now support Android Auto. And in Google Play, first-time buyers grew by nearly 50% year over year. I\u2019m very pleased with how these platforms are growing and creating amazing experiences for users, developers and partners.\nOur newest platform is Stadia, which revolutionizes the way gamers access and play their favorite games, and brings together the best of Google\u2019s infrastructure and open ecosystem approach. With Stadia, you\u2019ll be able to play advanced AAA games on any type of screen instantly, without ever needing to download the game or install updates. The reception from gamers and the industry has been incredible, and we look forward to sharing more when it launches later this year.\nNext, our video platform YouTube. YouTube\u2019s top priority is responsibility. As one example,\n\n earlier this year, YouTube announced changes that reduce recommendations of content that comes close to violating our guidelines, or that misinforms in harmful ways. There are a lot more improvements which we will be rolling out in the next few weeks, and our work is ongoing.\nWe\u2019ve also expanded the content offering, availability and the functionality on some of our newer YouTube experiences. YouTube TV is now available nationwide, with many new networks and channels added in Q1. YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are now available in 43 countries, up from 5 markets at the start of 2018. In mid-March, we launched YouTube Music in India, one of YouTube's fastest growing markets. Since launch, the YouTube Music app has been downloaded more than 15 million times in the country.\nYouTube\u2019s ad business -- for both brand and direct response campaigns -- continues to grow and support our creators. In Q1, we again saw how YouTube is the go-to destination for watching Super Bowl ads -- before, during and after the big game. This year, viewership of Super Bowl ads on YouTube during the game rose by nearly 60%.\nMore broadly across our ads business.\nOur advertising product team led by Prabhakar continues to build new products for marketers, with more than 100 enhancements introduced every quarter. We do rigorous testing on each of these improvements to ensure that we\u2019re creating the best experience for users and advertisers. Our focus has always been on investing for the long term rather than managing for results quarter to quarter.\nI feel really positive about the opportunities ahead and the innovations that we\u2019re bringing to marketers -- many of which are powered by machine learning. Philipp and our business teams have done a great job helping advertisers take full advantage of these new capabilities. For instance, more than 70% of our advertisers are already using automated bid strategies in Google Ads, and these ML-powered technologies help customers get better results for their investments.\nIn Q1, we began testing new shoppable ad units in Google Images so brands can highlight multiple products available for sale in sponsored image results. You\u2019ve also seen us make it easy for people to buy products and take action when shopping on the Google Assistant and Search with a universal cart on mobile, desktop and Google Home devices. Since we launched these capabilities a year ago, the number of participating merchants has increased sevenfold. Lastly, at the Game Developers Conference, we introduced a host of new advertising solutions for developers, like app campaigns for engagement, which help developers reengage players with relevant ads across Google\u2019s properties.\nNext, I\u2019ll give an update on our hardware and Cloud efforts.\nFirst, hardware. I\u2019m very proud that in only a few short years, we\u2019ve built a strong foundation in hardware. For example, demand for our Google Home family of products remains strong -- especially the Home Mini and Home Hub. The breadth and depth of our product lines across Pixel, Nest and Home is amazing, and you\u2019ll see us continue to develop this incredible lineup. The team has also done a lot of work to scale our operations, and we\u2019ll continue to optimize our\n\n distribution, branding and points of presence. We also announced a new campus and engineering hub in Taiwan, largely to support our hardware efforts.\nNot only are features like Night Sight in Pixel winning industry awards, but Net Promoter Scores tell us that many people who use our hardware products truly love them, which is particularly important as we move into this new era of computing.\nWe\u2019re still early in the hardware journey, and when I look ahead at the portfolio that we\u2019ve created across Pixel, Home and Nest, I feel really good about the range of products that we have.\nAnd finally, our growing Cloud business. Thomas has really hit the ground running. Just a few weeks ago, I was on stage with him at our Cloud Next event, where we hosted a sold out crowd of more than 30,000 attendees. As I said at Next, moving to the cloud should be simple and seamless. I was excited to announce Anthos, which gives customers a very elegant solution to both hybrid Cloud and multi-Cloud in a single technology stack. The early feedback from analysts, customers, and partners has been really great. We also announced innovations across many of our other products that enable developers to build and deploy AI, help enterprises to better secure their data, allow Android users to leverage their phones as a security key and much more.\nWe are also deeply committed to becoming the most customer-centric cloud provider for enterprise customers, and making it easier for companies to do business with us thanks to new contracting, pricing, and more. Today, 9 of the world's 10 largest media companies, 7 of the 10 largest retailers, and more than half of the 10 largest companies in manufacturing, financial services, communications, and software use Google Cloud.\nSome of the companies that we announced at Next included: The American Cancer Society and McKesson in Healthcare; Media and Entertainment companies like USA Today and Viacom; Consumer Packaged Goods brands like Unilever; Manufacturing and Industrial companies like Samsung and UPS; and Public Sector organizations like Australia Post.\nFinally, to support our customers\u2019 growth, we also announced the addition of two new Cloud regions in Seoul and Salt Lake City, which we plan to open in 2020. These new Cloud regions will build on our current footprint of 19 Cloud regions and 58 data centers around the world.\nTwenty years in and over 100,000 employees strong, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work that our teams at Google do every day. We have so many bright opportunities ahead, and seizing those opportunities starts with our investments in the communities where we operate -- around the world and right here at home.\nIn the U.S., not only are we expanding our workforce across the country, but we\u2019re helping people in every state gain the digital skills they need to succeed in today\u2019s economy. In fact, just one year after kicking off our collaboration with Goodwill, a quarter of a million Americans have learned new digital skills, and 27,000 have found a job.\nWe also feel a deep responsibility to make sure that as we grow our business, we\u2019re doing it with minimal impact on the environment. Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy\n\n than a typical data center, while delivering seven times more computing power than we did five years ago. Since 2017, we\u2019ve matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy, and I\u2019m proud that Google is the world\u2019s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy.\nI\u2019ve never been more excited about Google and where we\u2019re headed. I want to thank every Googler around the world for joining us on that journey.\nWith that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Thank\u200b \u200byou, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star and then the number one key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask you to please mute your line once your question has been stated. One moment for questions.\nAnd our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS):\u200b Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple parts on the revenue performance in the quarter. Ruth, you had called out potential volatility on the Q4 earnings call. Wanted to understand a little bit about what you were calling out in Q4 and how that might have manifested itself in Q1 on the product side of the equation so we can just better understand how much of it was isolated to Q1 or it might be a headwind as we move through the year. And as you look at the individual performance of the Ad divisions inside Sites, Desktop, Mobile Search, YouTube, it seems like you were still calling out strength in Mobile Search and YouTube. So could it be desktop Search where we actually saw some weakness in the quarter? Thanks so much for any granularity and color on that.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b Sure. Thanks, Eric.\nSo I tried to step back and start at the highest level. Obviously on a reported GAAP basis, revenue growth in Q1 reflects the FX headwind that we talked about in contrast to the tailwind last year. And as you know well, we don't report Sites revenues on a fixed FX basis. But the delta between fixed and floating growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on Sites revenue. Beyond that, I tried to draw out that the year-on-year growth rate in part reflects our strong 2018.\nAnd then, more to your question, as we indicated last quarter, the other item is the timing of product changes in ads can impact year-on-year growth rates. And we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long term. We do not manage by quarter. So we are introducing enhancements only after product testing. And that was sort of the overarching color that I was trying to give you.\nIn terms of desktop, it was a modest contributor to revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks, such as planning vacations or assessing insurance\n\n options. And as we've talked about on prior calls, we continue to see the ongoing importance of desktop for many users and many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. So I led with the items that are really driving the growth, but that was a bit more color on desktop for you.\nEric Sheridan (UBS):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Once again, Doug Anmuth, your line is now open. Please check your mute button.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan):\u200b Yep. Thanks. Sorry about that. So two questions. Just following up on Eric's on the revenue growth, Ruth, can you just give us a little bit more detail on the paid click growth, the decel that we saw to 39% from the 50s and 60s last year, if that's just a comp issue or something more specific. And then, just on the spending side, I want to understand a little more just how you're thinking about spending relative to three months ago. I know you talked about both capex moderating and then also headcount moderating three months ago. Just curious at least if headcount is still in that camp for your thinking, you know, just given that it seems like there's a pretty big ramp expected under the new Cloud CEO. Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b OK, so starting with clicks and CPCs, as we've discussed on prior calls, the biggest driver affecting both CPCs and click trends is YouTube engagement ads, with YouTube clicks representing the vast majority of total clicks. And so while YouTube clicks continued to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year, reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience.\nAnd then in terms of your two, spending -- the investment questions, in terms of headcount,\nfirst, we do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate slightly in 2019 from the year-on-year growth in 2018. And as I indicated in opening comments, we are continuing to invest in technical talent for priority areas like Cloud, Search, and ML. And so Cloud has been and continues to be the primary area of headcount growth and as Thomas indicated as well and I think Sundar did as well.\nIn terms of capex, just to fill out the last part, I think, of your question relative to my comments last quarter, that we expect the full year 2019 growth rate for capex to moderate quite significantly versus the year-on-year growth in 2018, there's no change in our expectation for the year on that point either.\nThe first quarter last year obviously included a sizable real estate acquisition in New York. But overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure, given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth. Technical infrastructure is the biggest driver of capex growth, but we do also continue to invest in office facilities. In fact, as we announced in the first quarter, we expect capex of over $13 billion in 2019 just in the U.S. in data center construction and offices, with major expansions in 14 states.\n\n And more generally, while we're investing aggressively to support our outlook for compute requirements, we're also very focused on improving efficiency with our technical infrastructure; and you can see that through our innovations in things like custom server hardware and TPUs, which can be more cost effective, especially for machine learning workloads.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan):\u200b Thank you, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs):\u200b Great. Thank you. Sundar, I have a question about Cloud. You guys are obviously talking more and more about it. But when do you think you're going to be in a position to share revenue figures or even growth rates similar to what the others have been sharing for quite some time? And then I guess a couple follow-ups to that are: What would you say the biggest competitive differentiators are of GCP? And what also -- what changes has Thomas implemented for 2019? What are any of the big changes he's focused on that maybe are different than what you were doing before? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Thanks, Heather. Good question. Overall, I would say I think you saw the momentum coming out of Next. And, I would say at a high level, the key differentiators which we are focused on and which we hear from customers, too -- the five key things are security and reliability, being really open about hybrid multi-cloud. Customers don't want to be locked into any one cloud provider. We want to be a platform for open source, and so we're really working well there and enabling options. AI/ML as a capability.\nAnd, finally, as customers think about digital transformations, we bring all of Google's advances to bear to help them through the journey.\nI think I would say Thomas is really building upon a strong foundation. But we are really accelerating and, scaling up go-to-market both internally and through our channel partners. It's been a huge focus. I'm incredibly excited that we just announced a couple weeks ago that Rob Enslin has joined us to head go-to-market. And along with Thomas, both of them bring close to three decades of serving enterprise customers. And so that reflects the commitment we have.\nI think we are building a strong business across all our verticals, and we definitely are seeing strong momentum and look forward to being able to share more at the appropriate time.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of\nEvercore. Your line is now open.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI):\u200b Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, one for Ruth, one for Sundar.\nWe noticed the larger-than-expected slowdown in the properties TAC in the quarter -- that includes costs of Mobile Search -- you know, while the Other Cost of Revenues, which includes YouTube content costs, seem to maintain an expected growth rate, you know, despite what you\n\n said about more moderate trends in hardware. So just wondering if that's a wise way to infer anything about the relative performance of Mobile Search revenue versus YouTube from those cost lines in the quarter. And then on Waymo, maybe for Sundar, we're hearing more and more about collaborations between ridesharing networks and AV providers, so the idea of mixed fleets or part human/part AV as a means of potential deployment of AV technology. So if you'd just comment if that mixed fleet approach would be something that you think Waymo would consider versus its own full-ride service network. Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b So in terms of the Sites TAC rate, a couple of things. We've discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow starting in the second quarter last year, and you saw that through the balance of 2018.\nAnd this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in Mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content costs are included in other cost of sales. And so, that's the most important thing to point to.\nThe other is -- we've previously discussed is, TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix,\net cetera. So I'd really point you to the first point there.\nAnd then as it relates to Waymo, you know, I guess a couple of things. We continue to be most focused on the ridesharing business here. We're pleased with the expansion in the number of Waymo riders that we've added since the last quarter. But as we've talked about on prior calls, we do continue to pursue a number of other opportunities. Long-haul trucking we've talked about, logistics, deliveries, personal-use vehicles, last-mile solutions for cities, and then probably more to your question, licensing our technology.\nAnd we did announce in March that we're making one of our 3D LiDAR sensors available to companies outside of the self-driving car service, beginning with robotics and physical security. In other words, in -- for warehouse use or for farming. And our view is that that can provide further operating leverage to our business. So we're actually looking at it in a number of different ways. But the primary focus continues to be on developing the ride-hailing business.\nAnthony DiClemente (Evercore ISI):\u200b Okay. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit\nSuisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse):\u200b Okay. Thanks. So, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on your Stadia commentary. How are your conversations with some of the larger PC and console publishers going right now? You obviously offer them an additional distribution outlet with billions of users, which is something they probably didn't have before. But what is the pushback that you might be getting from publishers, if any? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b I think they\u2019re genuinely -- I mean, I think we see genuine excitement because I think they see the opportunity for a shift, a point of inflection, but they realize the technical challenge of pulling something like this off. And so -- but once they get\n\n their hands on with the technology and then they see the experience, I think it really wins people over.\nAnd so we are having conversations across the board, across the board. And I think people are, you know, definitely engaging in a very committed way and they're investing in it. And so, it's up to us to bring it all together and have a compelling service later this year, and that's what the team is heads-down working on.\nBut I think not pushback per se, but they want to see our commitment, which is what we demonstrate. And they are working hard to make the investments on their side. And so it's a big joint effort, and it's working well.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley):\u200b Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, just to go back to the product changes. Ruth, any more color on sort of which products or regions are most impacted by these changes? And just so we can understand a little bit, can you just help us with the key user experience you're trying to solve for and sort of the message to your advertisers who may be growing their spend less now, why that's going to be positive for the long term. And then, Sundar, just to go to your comments about YouTube, you mentioned more potential changes coming on YouTube in the next couple weeks. Can you just talk to us about that a little bit. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Maybe I will start with the YouTube comments.\nI talked about in the area of content responsibility, we are definitely focused on making sure we are constantly improving how we are handling both in terms of reducing the content that shouldn't be there on the platform, and then, more importantly, making sure when we recommend content that we are recommending high-quality content as well as reducing harmful content or low-quality content being recommended.\nWe had a set of launches which we have rolled out. But I think there are more launches coming, which will constantly improve what you see in YouTube and continues to be the most important area of focus for them.\nOn the first question, you know, in terms of products -- I presume when you say back to product changes, I think you're talking about the advertising experience. I think the main thing I would say is I think we have a long-term way of thinking about where we want to go and we have a disciplined framework by which we think and evolve our products. We don't necessarily look at it from a quarter-on-quarter basis, though, we obviously have had consistent performances.\nWe approach our work differently. And so you are going to have quarter-to-quarter variations once in a while. But we remain confident about the opportunities we see, and I'm looking ahead to that and we are focused on that.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley):\u200b Okay. Thanks.\n\n Candice (Operator):\u200b Thank you and our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO):\u200b Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, you reminded us how April and\nMay are pretty big months for the quarter -- or for the company, with a series of your large annual events. And, of course, each of them, each of those businesses have their own goals and targets. But we also continue to hear more about your teams working together, for example, a large Cloud engagement leading to higher ad spending from an enterprise. Can you talk to us just a little bit about how you balance having your leaders grow their own businesses with also incentivizing them to work together? And then second and kind of completely differently, we'd love to just hear your updated views on data collection and use. I'm sure you've continued to have some dialogue with politicians and regulators. We've seen some reports on more potential changes in Chrome or within the advertising platform. Would love to hear how maybe your latest discussions are informing both the near- and long-term view on policies with regards to data collection and use. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Thanks. You are right, these are a couple of very busy months, and it\u2019s particularly busy leading up to I/O. And I would say in terms of how we work together, first of all, as a company, I think we take our OKR process extraordinarily serious, in a very committed way. And we do write cross-company OKRs. And it really reinforces ways by which different groups can work together. And we measure them and we hold people accountable to that. That's an important part of how we get at businesses, both while they're focused on their product areas or business, they need to work together.\nSecond, as a leadership attribute, it's something that's really important to me. And so it's something that the leaders across the table share that goal. And I think it's largely cultural as well.\nVis-\u00e0-vis privacy, it's actually one of our most important areas. As a company, we've always tried to stay a step ahead. User expectations around privacy are constantly evolving, and we stretch ourselves to meet them. And as part of that, through this year, we are continuing to do a lot of work just with the overall goal of making sure privacy works for everyone, is actually simple to use.\nAnd as part of that, we will have more changes through the course of this year, be it Chrome -- Chrome is super committed to making sure it's best-in-class in privacy and security, and we always put user experience first and follow through.\nThrough all these changes, we need to be mindful of the content ecosystem and the publisher ecosystem. Advertising continues to be an important way by which they create value and they see value. And so we are very thoughtful about how we approach our work.\nAnd there's been a lot of interest across the board. I think we early on engaged with GDPR. We are big supporters of it in terms of being constructive and working early to get ready. I think it's important U.S. supports -- has a clear framework on a federal basis for privacy regulation, and it's something we feel is timely as well, and so we have called for it. And happy to be thought leaders as well as engage where needed.\n\n Dan Salmon (BMO):\u200b Great. Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Baird.\nYour line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird):\u200b Great, thank you. I have a couple. First, one follow-up on the revenue growth dynamics, specifically, the sequential growth trend. I wonder if we should assume now that there's greater seasonality in Core Search, just given the increasing mix of shopping and product ad formats. And, Sundar, a question in AI and machine learning. Since clearly this remains an area of significant strength for the company, I'm wondering what stage of development you'd characterize these tools as being today and whether we should expect the overall pace of advancement from AI to accelerate in terms of products and services. Thank you very much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b On the first question, around seasonality and stuff, throughout the course of the year, we always deal with many events. No pattern is -- there are a few patterns which are consistent year-on-year. But there are always one-off events which happen, so there is in-built variations which we work through every quarter. And so I think that's a natural part of what we do.\nThere's definitely seasonality in businesses like Hardware. And you are right, commercial behavior has seasonality associated with it. But we do deal a lot with one-off events as well. But we always work our way through it.\nOn machine learning, I do think we are at very early days. I'm excited that over the last three years, taking an AI-first approach, we have really incorporated machine learning core -- in a core way across our product to benefit our users. And that's true for advertising as well. I think we are in early stages of making it easier for businesses to understand what they're looking for and us taking care of more and more work. And we are doing it across the board, but there is a lot of headroom here.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Bank of America):\u200b Thank you. Maybe one for Ruth and one for Sundar. First, Ruth, on Mobile Search, can you let us know how that did versus your expectations? I know there's a lot of noise from YouTube in that line. But how is Mobile Search doing? And what are the key drivers now for Mobile Search? Is it queries? Is it driving higher click-through rates? Ad format changes? What are the drivers as you think about the next couple years? And then, Sundar, could you just -- on the Hardware business, I think there are some concerns that it's just not getting off to a really strong trajectory, some comparisons to Microsoft ten years ago. Really just help us understand how that Hardware business is important to Google and how you're thinking about it long term. Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b So in terms of Mobile Search and the Sites revenue more broadly, I think the main point, as we've both tried to indicate in opening comments, is we view the advertising opportunity as significant, in particular, the opportunity with machine\n\n learning, both for users and advertisers, as well as our commitment to product innovation and being, you know, the backdrop of an environment in which nearly half of ad budgets in the U.S. are still spent offline and about 90% of commerce in the U.S. is still offline. And we're focused on digital playing a bigger role in that and tapping into other marketing budgets by offering an attractive ROI.\nAnd then, you know, apart from people spending more time on digital content, to your question, we know that better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experiences all help grow the pie for everyone in the ecosystem.\nAnd then more broadly, you know, within YouTube, as we talked about last quarter, we do continue to see significant growth in direct response, and we remain excited about the upside potential there. Brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace. But we called out direct response given what we see as the upside potential.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b Justin, on the Hardware business, as I said earlier, we are still in our early days. But our commitment is very strong. We really see it as incredibly important to drive the future of computing forward and to make sure our services are presented to users, in a -- in the way that we intended them to be. And so, overall, we view it as a hugely important opportunity.\nWhen we look at the business, even for -- given we are more recent to it, we already -- if you take areas like Google Home and Assistant products, we are doing really well. We see strong momentum. I think we are market leaders in the category and -- especially when you take a look at it on a global basis. And so computing will continue to evolve even beyond phones.\nAnd so we want to make sure we are in there, and we are very committed to it for the long term.\nPhones definitely across -- as an industry, I think we are working through a phase where there is definite, you know, year-on-year headwinds.\nBut I do think especially the ecosystem is constantly pushing it forward. I continue to be excited about the innovations, be it 5G coming or the early look into foldable phones, which Android plays a big part in driving. So I do think there is a lot more to come. And -- and we are focused on it. And when I look at the product quality, how it's improving, user feedback in terms of Net Promoter Scores and the range of lineup that we are working and how our products are getting better year-on-year, I remain very excited.\nColin Sebastian (Baird):\u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of\nBarclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays):\u200b Hey, guys, I guess I'll just beat the dead horse on the deceleration comment again, but maybe a different way. Ruth, so why did Europe and U.S. Europe ex FX and U.S. growth rates drop off much more than Asia and than other? Any comment on why the decel was more pronounced in Western markets? And then, stepping back, we've seen pretty solid growth rates from the digital ads sector broadly in the first quarter. And you flagged a lot of this back in February, so, clearly, this isn't a surprise to you. But how much of the, you know,\n\n deceleration in Sites ex FX was from maybe advertiser demand issues in these markets versus proactive changes that you may have made on your end to the product? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b So in terms of the regions, the year-on-year growth rates reflect the product comments that I made with respect to the first quarter, you know, I think the -- you had the U.S. -- U.S. and Europe had about the same delta year-on-year. Other Americas was more pronounced. That was really more of the impact of Hardware.\nAnd then APAC, I think, maybe is what was guiding some of your question, continues to be a very strong performer and continued to deliver in the 30% plus -- I think 31% on a fixed FX basis. We're well-positioned, growth throughout the region. Sundar's comment on some of the things that we're seeing, a big focus on the next billion users and excited about the opportunities across the board there.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google:\u200b And I don't think there were any demand issues to the last part of your question. And as we said earlier, we work through a set of product development pipeline in a very disciplined way, focused on user experience. And that makes its way, too, and that's how we approach it.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And our next question will be our final question today, from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies):\u200b Thanks. Just a follow-up on the last question on EMEA and U.S. Was there any go-to-market changes in terms of the salesforce or, you know, how you set quota or anything that may have been effectively a Q1 seasonality issue that may see some snapback in Q2?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:\u200b The opening comment I said that, one of the points is that we had a strong year last year and we're looking at performance in line with that.\nI would say, more broadly, overall, in terms of go-to-market, our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged. We're excited about the opportunities ahead. We do continue to invest to ensure we remain well-positioned for the long term. That applies across the businesses. And so there wasn't a change that -- anything other than the comments that I had made.\nI think if I can just maybe expand on the investing pace. You know, as we're looking at the pace of investing and supporting growth around the globe, what we're really looking at is what's needed to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.\nYou know, the operating margin did benefit in -- as I noted in my opening comments, that -- from the fact that the Q1 marketing expenses growth moderated. But that was a timing issue. We do expect to pick up in marketing expense in the second quarter. And other than that, really nothing to comment on.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): \u200b Thank you.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.\n\n I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations:\u200b Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call.\nThank you and have a good afternoon.\nCandice (Operator):\u200b Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.", "20192": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see  the Q2 2019 Earnings Call webcast.  \n\nAlphabet Q2 2019 Earnings Call  July 25, 2019 \n\nCandice (Operator): Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet second  quarter 2019 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will  conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If anyone  should require operator assistance, please press star and then zero on your touch-tone  telephone. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead. \n\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to  Alphabet\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and  Ruth Porat. Now I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today  regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital  expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information,  please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation  of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is  distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at  abc.xyz/investor. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sundar. \n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Ellen. Q2 was an exciting quarter at Google.  \nWe made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube\u2019s Brandcast, and Google Marketing  Live. They are all part of our broader vision to build a more helpful Google for everyone. When  we say everyone, we mean users, developers, creators, partners, advertisers and, all the  customers of our growing Cloud business, and the communities we call home.  \n\nFrom the beginning, Google\u2019s mission has been to organize the world\u2019s information and make it  universally accessible and useful. Over the years, we\u2019ve evolved from a company that helps  people find answers to a company that helps you get things done.  \n\nToday, I\u2019ll share how we\u2019re approaching this work.   \nBuilding a more helpful Google starts with advancing our core information mission.   \nIn Q2, we\u2019ve made a number of improvements to our founding product: Search. We redesigned  our mobile Search page and brought our popular Full Coverage feature to Search to better  organize news results. We\u2019re also integrating augmented reality into Search. So if, say, you\u2019re  searching for new shoes online, you can view the shoes in 3D or even superimpose them onto  your wardrobe to see if they match.  \n\nThanks to advancements in AI, we\u2019re making significant improvements to the Google Assistant.  The next generation Assistant can process requests up to 10 times faster, making it easier to multitask, compose emails, and even work offline. With features like Duplex on the Web, the  Assistant will soon be able to help users book rental cars and buy movie tickets.  \n\nIf you\u2019re searching for the fastest way home, Google Maps will now tell you when your bus is  delayed or how packed your next train will be. We\u2019ve rolled this out to people in 200 cities  worldwide. Google Maps can also help people stay safe in times of crisis. Last month, we  added more visual information and a new navigation warning system to help you understand  where a natural disaster is and better anticipate where it may be headed.  \n\nBuilding a more helpful Google for everyone means that everyone should be able to access and  enjoy our products.  \n\nThat\u2019s why we are applying the latest advances in AI to dramatically improve experiences for  people with disabilities. One example of this is captions, which make content more accessible  to the almost 500 million people in the world who are deaf or hard of hearing. In Android Q, we  can now add automatic Live Captions to any media playing on your phone, such as videos,  podcasts and voicemails.  \n\nWe\u2019re also developing technology for the next billion users coming online in places like India,  Brazil and Indonesia. Yesterday, we introduced the Gallery Go app. It\u2019s a way for people living  in low-connectivity areas to manage their photos and videos while offline. Google Photos  continues to be one of our most popular and beloved products, now with over one billion  monthly users. And we\u2019re excited by the potential of Gallery Go to bring these benefits to the  next billion users.  \n\nBuilding for everyone also means ensuring that privacy is equally available to everyone.   \nIn Q2, we announced privacy improvements to give users clear choices and more control  around their data. We\u2019re making privacy controls more easily accessible, expanding our popular  Incognito Mode to Maps, and adding new auto-delete controls. And we continue to challenge  the notion that products need more data to be more helpful. For example, we invented a new  technique called Federated Learning that allows us to train AI models and make products  smarter without raw data leaving your device.  \n\nTo make products work even harder for you, we\u2019ve continued to invest in our Hardware  business, bringing together the best of Google\u2019s hardware, software and AI.  \n\nAt I/O, we introduced some new additions to our Hardware lineup, including Pixel 3a and Pixel  3a XL. By taking advantage of our leading software capabilities, we can offer users a premium  phone experience at a much lower price point. With the launch of Pixel 3a in May, overall Pixel  unit sales in Q2 grew more than 2x year over year. In addition to Verizon and the Google store,  we successfully expanded our distribution to T-Mobile, Sprint, US Cellular, Spectrum Mobile,  and additional partners, which has greatly diversified our sales footprint in the U.S. Finally,  we're also pleased that the Pixel 3a launch was met with our highest Net Promoter Score  ratings to date. \n\nWe\u2019re also doubling down on creating a \u201chelpful home\u201d -- bringing all of our Home products  together under the Nest brand. In Q2, we launched the Nest Hub in 12 additional countries.  \n\n Demand across our helpful home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets. Our new Google Nest Hub Max, a voice-activated smart display powered by the Google  Assistant, will be available later this summer. Stay tuned for even more on Hardware this fall. \n\nBeyond Hardware, we continue to develop the open platforms and ecosystems that push  computing forward, such as Android, Google Play, and Chrome.  \n\nAt I/O, we showed some exciting improvements to Android Q: it\u2019s the first operating system to  support 5G; includes support for foldable phones; and has nearly 50 updates focused on  security and privacy, including more transparency and control over location data you share with  apps.  \n\nAnd, we continue to feel the excitement from users, developers, and publishers following the  announcement of our new gaming platform, Stadia. We recently announced pricing, availability,  and over 30 games coming to Stadia in time for the consumer launch in November.  \n\nAnother area where we are investing deeply is YouTube.   \nEvery day, users come to YouTube to learn new things. As a result, YouTube has become one  of the world\u2019s most accessible educational platforms. \n\nWe see strong growth in a number of areas. Creators continue to build engaged fan bases on  YouTube. Channels with more than one million subscribers grew by 75% year over year.  Thousands of channels have doubled their total monthly revenue by using new monetization  products like SuperChat, Channel Memberships and Merch. And we\u2019re building momentum with our subscription services\u2014YouTube Music and YouTube Premium\u2014now available in over 60  countries, up from 5 markets at the start of 2018. \n\nAt Brandcast, we introduced two important changes that help advertisers reach new audiences  with premium content. First, new YouTube Originals series, movies and live events will soon be made available for free\u2014supported by ads. Second, YouTube TV, with its 70+ channels, will be  accessible as a standalone lineup in Google Preferred. \n\nAs we continue to invest in the platform, responsibility remains our top priority. One significant  change we made in Q2 was to update our hate speech policy. And we continue to be vigilant  about removing harmful content quickly and at scale. In the first quarter alone, we removed  more than 8 million videos that violated our Community Guidelines. The vast majority of those  videos were flagged by machines, and removed before getting a single view. We\u2019re also  working to raise up high-quality content and support our creators, who are our next-generation  media businesses. These are a few of the many investments we\u2019ve made to protect the  community. The work is ongoing and we are committed to it.  \n\nMoving from YouTube to broader advertising platforms.   \nAt Google Marketing Live, we introduced new ad formats such as Discovery Ads, which offer a  new visually rich, mobile-first ad experience across Google properties. We also announced a  unified shopping experience and universal shopping cart -- all of which help to make Google  more shoppable. \n \n\n\n\n \nWe also announced Google Travel, a new centralized travel destination where people can plan  and organize all aspects of their next trip all in one place -- from booking flights and  accommodations to planning activities. \n\nNow on to our Cloud business.  \nQ2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of  over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace. \n\nCustomers are choosing Google Cloud for a variety of reasons. Reliability and uptime are  critical: retailers like Lowe\u2019s are leveraging the Cloud as one of the important tools to transform  their customer experience and supply chain.  \n\nCustomers need flexibility to move to Cloud in their own way: Anthos, announced earlier this  year, provides advanced security and open architecture to support multi-and hybrid Cloud  environments. That\u2019s important to many companies, including financial services customers like  HSBC and new clients, such as Keybank.  \n\nScalable data management and analytics solutions are another strength of Google Cloud:  Vodafone is using Cloud to drive real-time customer and network analytics; and BrightInsight, a leading healthcare platform for connected devices and drugs, uses our solutions to improve  security and compliance.  \n\nFinally, Google Cloud\u2019s AI and ML solutions are also helping healthcare organizations like  Sanofi accelerate drug discovery and Ascension improve the healthcare experience and  outcomes.  \n\nWe continue to build our world class Cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business, and are looking to triple our salesforce over the next few years. \n\nFinally, to support our rapidly growing cloud customer base and all of Google\u2019s services  globally, we broke ground on three data centers, and launched our new Osaka Cloud region -  the seventh in Asia Pacific. We also announced plans for a new Cloud region in Las Vegas, our seventh in the United States. \n\nLastly, beyond investments in products, we\u2019re investing significantly in the communities where  we operate. In Europe, we recently announced a 1 billion euro data center investment in the  Netherlands, as well as the opening of our Google Safety Engineering Center in Munich,  Germany.  \n\nAnd right here at home, we announced a $1 billion investment in housing across the Bay Area  to help address the chronic shortage of affordable housing. Earlier this week, we invested $50  million in Housing Trust Silicon Valley\u2019s TECH Fund, which furthers our goal to help  communities succeed over the long term and expands access to housing for those who need it  most.  \n\n\nFinally, I\u2019m excited that Google is an official supporter of the Olympic and Paralympic Games  \n\n\n\n Tokyo 2020. It\u2019s particularly special since that\u2019s where we opened our first international office  back in 2001. Ahead of the games, we\u2019re working with the city of Tokyo to ensure Japanese  businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there  using products like Search, Maps and Translate.  \n\nAt Google, we feel incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to help so many people every  day in moments big and small.  \n\nThere are many reasons to be optimistic about the direction technology is taking, from the  applications of AI to address disease to the potential of quantum computing to deepen our  understanding of the world.  \n\nI want to thank Googlers around the world for another great quarter.  \nWith that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ruth.   \nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Sundar. In the second quarter, Total  Revenues of $38.9 billion, were up 19% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once  again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search in particular, as well as  YouTube and Cloud. \n\nI will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing  on year-over-year changes. \n\nI will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook.  We will then take your questions.  \n\nLet me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.  Our total revenues of $38.9 billion reflect an acceleration in both reported and constant  currency revenue growth across all regions, compared with the first quarter. Details of our  results by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. \n\nTurning to profitability, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I  will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.3 billion, up 25% year-on-year. \n\nOther cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year,  primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest contributor was costs associated with  our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition  costs - primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising-supported content, but also for our  newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC  as a percentage of their revenues. This line was also impacted by growth in hardware costs  associated with the launch of our line of mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones. \n\nOperating expenses were $12.5 billion, with headcount growth as the largest driver across each  of R&D, Sales & Marketing and G&A. \n\nThe biggest increase once again was in R&D expenses reflecting our focus on product  innovation. Growth in Sales & Marketing expenses also reflects an increase in advertising and  \n\n promotional expense, primarily for the launch of our Pixel 3a lineup.  \nStock-based compensation totaled $2.8 billion. Headcount was up 4,187 from last quarter and  consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. \nIn terms of product areas, the most sizeable headcount increases were again in Cloud, for both technical and sales roles. \n\nOperating income was $9.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the EC fine  in the second quarter of last year, for an operating margin of 24%.  \n\nOther Income and Expense was $3.0 billion, reflecting sizable gains, which are primarily  unrealized, from investments made by CapitalG, GV and more broadly at Alphabet. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.  \n\nNet income was $9.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $14.21.   \nTurning now to Capex and operating cash flow:  \nCash Capex for the quarter was $6.1 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating Cash Flow was $12.6 billion with Free Cash Flow of $6.5 billion. \n\nWe ended the quarter with Cash & Marketable Securities of approximately $121 billion.   \nLet me now turn to our segment financial results.   \n\nStarting with the Google segment, revenues were $38.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year. In  terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27.3 billion in the quarter, up 18%  year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up  9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within  Network, namely Google Ad Manager, followed by AdMob.  \n\nOther revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, with an  ongoing strong contribution from Play. Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again the primary  driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics  products. G Suite continues to be a valued set of productivity and work transformation apps,  with results benefiting from both new pricing and seat growth. Play\u2019s results were driven by  strong growth in the number of active buyers. Hardware benefited from the successful launch of  our Pixel 3a smartphones. \n\nWe provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price  and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. \n\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $7.2 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up  13% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was down  year-over-year, reflecting primarily a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites. The  Sites TAC rate increased year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to  mobile, which carries higher TAC, offset by the growth in TAC-free Sites revenues, primarily \n\n\n \n\n from YouTube. In Q2, the Network TAC rate declined year on year, primarily due to a favorable  product mix shift.  \n\nOperating income was $10.4 billion, up 16% versus last year, and the operating margin was  26.8%. \n\nAccrued Capex for the quarter was $6.9 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and  data centers, followed by servers. \n\nLet me now turn to and talk about Other Bets.  \nRevenues were $162 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily, with an Operating Loss of $989 million. \n\nI\u2019ll note a couple of key recent accomplishments. Waymo now has over 1,000 active riders  participating in Waymo One and has reached 10 billion miles driven in simulation. Waymo also  announced that it has entered into an exclusive partnership with Renault and Nissan to explore  driverless mobility services for passengers and deliveries in France and Japan. \n\nLoon was once again able to step in and provide connectivity in the aftermath of a natural  disaster after the recent earthquake in Peru. This follows previous deployments of Loon after  hurricanes in Puerto Rico and floods in Peru. \n\nLet me now conclude with some comments about our longer-term outlook. Based on the  strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect continued  FX headwinds again in the third quarter. As a reminder, FX headwinds affect both revenues  and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S.  \n\nTurning to revenues, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum in our revenue growth,  especially on a base of nearly $150 billion in revenues over the last 12 months.  \n\nWith respect to Sites revenues, the strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing  innovation, in part from the benefits of applying machine learning. We remain confident about  the ongoing opportunity set. \n\nAnd within Other revenues, once again, Cloud was the largest driver within Other revenues and the third largest driver of revenue growth for Alphabet overall. In fact, in the second quarter of  2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and  Cloud continues to deliver significant growth. \n\nIn terms of our Hardware business, we were pleased with the reception of the Pixel 3a lineup of mid-tier smartphones in the second quarter and look forward to the fourth quarter launch of our  newest devices, some of which we showcased at I/O.  \n\nTurning to profitability, with regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results  once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term. At this point, we  expect that our 2019 headcount growth rate will be closer to the 2018 rate, in other words  slightly higher than we originally forecast, for a couple of reasons. \n\n\n \n\n \nStrategically, we are increasing our hiring in Cloud and are incorporating the impact of the  Looker acquisition, which we expect to close before the end of this year and, operationally,  we\u2019re taking steps to optimize workforce deployment by moving certain customer support  functions in-house which is both opex neutral and enhances operational effectiveness.  \n\nAs a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when  we bring on new graduates. \n\nIn terms of Sales and Marketing, consistent with prior years, we expect Sales and Marketing to  be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year to support the holiday season. \n\nIn Other Bets, we continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity we see.  \nTurning to Capex and capital allocation. To give you more insight into our investment in capital  expenditures, I will discuss the two major components of Google Capex separately. First, the  majority of our Google Capex is what we refer to as Technical Infrastructure, which consists of  our investments for compute, storage and networking requirements, and includes data center  land and construction, servers and network equipment.  \n\nThe second category of Capex is for our office facilities, including acquisitions, ground up  development projects and related building improvements. \n\nIn the last couple of years within Google Capex, on average approximately 70% was for  technical infrastructure and 30% was for office facilities. Both the split between the two  components and year-on-year growth rates can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due  primarily to the timing of sizable purchases of office facilities.  \n\nFor example, in Q1, technical infrastructure was about 80% of Google Capex whereas in Q2 it  accounts for about 60%, due to the purchases of office facilities we made in the quarter. \n\nAs we discussed on the fourth quarter call, we believe there are two important factors when  considering our pace of capex investing. First, we expect the overall growth rate will moderate  quite significantly for the full year 2019 versus 2018. Second, in terms of the mix within  technical infrastructure, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments  relative to servers, in contrast to the ranking in 2018. \n\nGrowth in technical infrastructure is designed to support, in particular, our efforts in Machine  Learning across our businesses, as well as to support growth in Cloud, Search, and YouTube. \n\nWith respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic  growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We  complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release  today, our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $25 billion of our Class C  Capital Stock. \n\nIn conclusion, we are confident about the opportunities ahead and continue to invest  thoughtfully for the long term.   \n\n \nWe will now take your questions.   \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time,  please press star and then the number one key on your touch tone telephone. If your question  has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound  key. And to prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your phone after your  question has been stated. \n\nAnd our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.  \nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks for taking the question and really appreciate all the additional  commentary and disclosure in the remarks. I think investors will find that really helpful. Sundar,  maybe for you, one bigger-picture question. A lot of innovation on the product side in the early  part of this year, and now those products are going to start getting rolled out in the back part of  this year and into 2020. Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what some of the key  investments you're making, some of the key themes you are trying to drive after in terms of  pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strengths within  Google. And then the second part of the question would be, as you lower friction for consumers  on the product side, what are you hearing from advertisers on the monetization side about how  those products might resonate on the monetization piece? Thank you so much.  \n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Eric.  \nIn terms of the key investments, you know, we still continue -- you know, we have been focused  on our investments in AI. So that continues to be kind of a foundational investment we are  making across the board, including getting a lot of our engineers trained on AI techniques, \net cetera, across the board. So it's an important area we are focused on. And, you know,  making sure -- digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful, you know, is the main  theme by which we are evaluating everything we do. \n\nBeyond that, you know, be it -- you know, the focus on Cloud has been a big part of it,  continuing to scale up YouTube, including being focused on content responsibility. These are  all some of the key things we are doing; and, of course, you know, a deep focus on Search and  Assistant being a core part of everything we do. \n\nIn terms of the work we are doing on consumers and impact it has on monetization -- and, you  know, I do think they go hand in hand -- as we are making the experience better for consumers,  including on products like Discover, so just getting information to them more seamlessly when  they need it. I think they all, you know, tend to have a commercial aspect, the right intent when  users are interested in it. So while we see them go hand in hand, so taking a long-term view I  think will resonate on the monetization side as well. \n\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you.    \n\n Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then building a bit on that question and the  impact from some of the announcements that you have seen from us, you know, I'll just  comment a bit on the impact from Google Marketing Live that Sundar referenced at the outset.  You know, I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announce new changes to  products and features. And most Ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats. And so as a result, the new products that were  announced at GML typically are adopted over time.  \n\nAnd so just wanted to add in here, because while we are excited about the new Ads products  we announced at GML last quarter, given they offer great new user experiences across new  services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in  previous years.  \n\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Great. Thank you.  \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JP  Morgan. Your line is now open.  \n\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping, Ruth,  you could talk a little bit more just about the accelerating growth that you saw in 2Q relative to  the slowdown that we saw in 1Q. It seemed certainly in the previous quarter to skew more to  the Google Search side than YouTube. I was just hoping you could provide a little more clarity  on maybe how the product changes that you've talked about in the past played out across 1Q  and 2Q. And then, just, Sundar, on user privacy and control over data, that was certainly a key  theme across the multiple events in 2Q. Can you just talk about how you balance those  initiatives as you're rolling out products going forward. Thanks.  \n\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So starting first with the strength in Sites revenue,  the strength we talked about here this quarter reflects the same underlying trends that we  discussed previously. And I tried to really call that out in opening comments. In part it's the  benefit from applying machine learning to both the user and advertiser experience. And it really just -- you know, I'm echoing a lot of what we've said in prior quarters, last quarter as well. We  remain very positive about the opportunity set. \n\nWe introduce product changes only after extensive testing, which means there can be some  variability in quarterly growth rates, as you\u2019ve seen, but, you know, are very positive about the  opportunity set and, you know, overall as it relates to both Search and YouTube strength.  \n\nI would just add on YouTube, revenue growth for YouTube was strong in the first quarter. In  fact, we called it out as the second largest driver of revenue growth across Alphabet. And in  the second quarter, YouTube was again the second largest contributor of revenue growth and,  you know, really pleased with the ongoing momentum that we're seeing here.  \n\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On user privacy and control, it's always been a big focus for us.  And some of the things we recently announced, you know, were initiatives under way, for  \n\n\n example, like Federated Learning, for almost three years. So going forward, I think you will  continue to see us focus on it. It's one of the most important areas we are working on.  \n\nBut I think with AI, we are excited that, you know, we can give the -- give better experiences for  users with less data over time. And, you know, those are the kinds of directions we are  pushing.  \n\nWe are also -- you'll see us continue to work hard to simplify user understanding of how their  data is used and giving them better controls and making it more easy for them to manage and  making sure more users actually exercise those controls. So those are all our goals. And we'll  continue focusing on that as we move forward.  \n\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thank you, both.  \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit  Suisse. Your line is now open.  \n\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Okay. Thank you. So, Ruth, in regards to the Cloud $8 billion  annual run rate commentary, just wondering if we can get some clarifications there. Does this  include GCP as well as G Suite? And further, is this apples to apples to, I guess, the $1 billion  that I think Sundar talked about? I think that was during the fourth quarter of '17. And any  other commentary you can add there in terms of the mix between, I guess, you know, the --  traditional -- more GCP versus the more traditional G Suite? Thank you.  \n\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Yeah. So it does include the entire business that  Thomas Kurian is leading, our Cloud business. It includes both GCP and G Suite. And it is on  an apples-to-apples basis. It continues to be the business -- the Cloud business. We're not  breaking out the components of Cloud. As I tried to indicate in opening comments, pleased with the performance of both GCP and G Suite growth.  \n\nAnd GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products.  And G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in opening comments, with results  benefiting from both new pricing and seat growth. And overall, GCP remains one of the fastest  growing businesses in Alphabet. And we're really pleased with how the team is executing on  both.  \n\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.  \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from  Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.  \n\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you very much. And I'll just echo people's  comments about the new disclosure. It's much appreciated. So thank you so much for sharing. I wanted to ask, Sundar, how you've seen your go-to-market and partnership strategies change  under Thomas. It does seem as if Google has become the more friendly Cloud company, if you\n \n\n\n\n will, from a -- you know, when you think about partnering with other software companies. And  I'm wondering if there's any tangible benefits you can point to because of this, whether it's in  win rates or partner momentum or anything else that you can call out. And then I also wanted  to ask -- you obviously made the acquisition of Looker recently -- how you're thinking about  organic versus inorganic product development. And I'm just wondering, has the thought  process there changed with Thomas running the business now? Thank you. \n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Heather, I appreciate it. You know, definitely,  go-to-market, Thomas has been heavily focused on it, you know, mainly with the realization that  we are very competitive when we are there in the mix and so focusing on how we can scale up  and really build a customer-facing organization. So we are investing heavily, be it in sales,  service, partner, and operational teams. \n\nAnd as I mentioned in my opening comments, you know, we're looking to triple the size of our  sales force over the next few years, and we're doing it aggressively in major markets around  the world. \n\nSome specifics. You know, we did launch our new partner program, Partner Advantage. The  SAP relationship has been super important to us, and so we have really focused on that,  helping many customers. McKesson, Carrefour, Home Depot, Cardinal Health are some  examples of that. \n\nAnd -- you know, and a big part of it has been really expanding our customer-facing bench, you know, several new senior executive hires. In addition to our new global head of sales, we  recently added a 25-year customer experience veteran to build out our customer support. So I  think you're going to see that focus of being -- serving customers. We have done it in our other areas. We are used to building ecosystems. If you look at an ecosystem like Android, this is  what we do. And so that's going to be a focus for us. \n\nIn terms of the second question, about organic versus inorganic, I think, you know, we are  clearly focused on the areas where we are differentiated. Data and business analytics was a  key -- data management and analytics is a key area for us. And as part of that, we looked at  gaps we have which would help us complete the solution offering we have there for customers. And that's what drove the Looker acquisition. \n\nSo we'll be customer focused. And to the extent we see gaps there -- gaps anywhere, we'll  obviously look at doing it in-house versus whether there's an attractive opportunity outside and  take it on a case-by-case basis. But that's where it will come from. \n\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.  \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from  RBC. Your line is now open.  \n\n\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Can I try two questions, please. First, Ruth, just any color on that  \n\n\n\n $25 billion share repurchase authorization? Why 25, not 20, not 30? Any color there? And  then when you think about the Ad business, you know, we've seen this nice acceleration in Q2,  but that's kind of back to norm. There's still this question about what happened in Q1. Was  there something that happened in Q1 that you needed to correct in Q2? Is it just the normal  rhythms of the Search and YouTube and advertising businesses? So I find Q1 still a little bit of  a question mark. Q2 seems like very much the norm of the last several years. So any color on what could have transpired in Q1 and did that require a fix in Q2? Thanks a lot. \n\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Well, I'll answer them in reverse order. You know, I  tried to comment on that last quarter, and reiterated again this quarter, you know, we are  pleased with the ongoing momentum of the business. And the key point that I'll just reiterate is  that, as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business, and we've talked about  that, we introduce product changes only after extensive testing. And that means there can be  variability in quarterly growth rates, as you've seen. \n\nAnd so, you know, we're pleased with the strength of the business. The team is extremely  focused on ensuring or delivering for users and advertisers. And as we're looking out -- you  know, we've talked in the past, we have introduced over 100 enhancements to the user set  every quarter and no one change drives results. And as we discussed last quarter, you know,  there can be timing variability. And our view is, let's ensure that we stay focused on the right  things for the long-term and the quality that we can deliver. So, you know, it's -- there's really  not much more to add there.  \n\nAnd then on the capital return, I guess, you know, the main point is, we went back to the -- you  know, we're staying with the same capital allocation framework we've talked with you about  before. The primary thing is, we remain focused on investing for long-term growth. And the  primary use of capital really is to support that growth.  \n\nAnd then the second use is really to support acquisitions and investments, as we've already  been talking about. And given the -- our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate  to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in  2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the \n$25 billion. And I think the main point is, we view the repurchase program as an effective use  of capital. \n\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Okay. Thanks, Ruth.  \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from  Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \n\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first, Ruth,  your color on YouTube was really helpful on it being the second largest driver this quarter and  last quarter. I guess, with that as a backdrop, with the overall acceleration, can you just give us a couple examples of what types of products or advertiser segments or regions resonated  particularly well on YouTube this quarter versus last quarter? And then sort of a question for \n \n\n\n Sundar or Ruth. There has been a decent amount in the press about children's safety on  YouTube. And so I guess I would be curious to hear for advertisers and parents on the call,  what steps have you taken to really make sure that YouTube is safe for kids? And what are  some of the biggest areas you are focused on to ensure it stays that way? Thanks. \n\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a  bit more there, given your question, you know, I already noted that YouTube revenue growth  was strong in the first quarter and, again, strong here in the second quarter. \n\nTo clarify, you know, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last quarter  regarding Sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy enforcement actions at  YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. Just to be really clear, the  revenue growth was strong last quarter. And so the click and CPC growth were unrelated to  actions on policy enforcement.  \n\nIn terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube ecosystem, we do remain focused on  taking the right steps in line with our goals regardless of the impact on revenues. But an  important point is that our removal of content that violates our policies had virtually no impact on  YouTube revenues. Just wanted to make sure that was clear. So consistent growth here. \n\nGoing into the first part of your question, where is that growth, again, I'm going to reiterate what  we've talked about on prior calls, that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response.\n\nSo brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace. But, really, I would reiterate what we said previously, that we continue to see substantial growth in  direct response. \n\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On your important question about kid safety, you know, as part\nof our content responsibility work, it's one of the most important areas we focus on. You will \nsee this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids. And, you know, it's a  product you're going to see us focus more and continue to evolve, add more curated content  there and make sure it's safe for kids and gives parents peace of mind. Also ensuring that the  content responsibility work applies to family-oriented content on the main YouTube app as well.  \n\nSo all the work we are doing, be it the work we are doing to just remove bad content, raise up  authoritative content, higher-quality content, and reducing the spread of borderline content, all  applies everywhere. And, you know, we are really focused on it. \n\nRewarding trusted creators is a big way we can help -- you know, ensuring creators who  produce content which is great for children, rewarding them, et cetera, are also important goals  for us.  \n\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks.  \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO  Capital Markets. Your line is now open. \n \n\n \nDan Salmon (BMO): Right. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.  Maybe best for Ruth, but, Sundar, feel free to jump in. The first one here is based on a couple  of comments you\u2019ve reminded us of in your prepared remarks about YouTube, which was the  inclusion of Originals and YouTube TV into Google Preferred inventory. You've given us a little  bit of color on direct response growth at YouTube over the last little while. Can we assume that  those two additions were a bit of a boost to the brand advertising side of the business, as that's  more inventory available for that sort of high-quality type of brand orientation that TV  advertisers are looking for? And then just second, coming back to Google Marketing Live,  notwithstanding your comments, Ruth, that it takes some time for products to be adopted, are  there maybe one or two out of all of those announcements there that you would highlight as  being, you know, potentially particularly material over the longer term? Thank you. \n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: On the first stuff, in terms of YouTube for brand, you know, I  would say it's more secular across the platform, promoting higher quality content. Our work on  brand safety, content responsibility, you know, adds up to it. \n\nAlso, you know, creators just, you know, generating better content, I think all have played a  part. And, you know, so I would say it's more cross-cutting. \n\nOn the second thing, on GML, in terms of things we were excited about, to me, be it Discovery  Ads and Gallery Ads, I mean, they both are pushing us towards mobile-first, visually rich,  immersive ad formats, which is -- you know, which also offers a really great user experience.  So I think I'm excited about changes like that. And I think -- I think, you know, they have the  potential. \n\nThere is advertiser excitement. But as Ruth mentioned, it's early days. Anything we roll out  now, you know, takes time to play out. But we definitely see excitement there.  \n\nDan Salmon (BMO): Great. Thanks, Sundar.   \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open.  \n\nMark May (Citi): Thank you. My first is for Sundar. I think earlier, Ruth had mentioned the  importance of machine learning for driving, you know, growth in the quarter and I'm sure in  many recent quarters. I believe many have kind of a hard time understanding exactly what that  means. And I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning, you know, recently to help drive growth and improvements for,  you know, both users and advertisers. And then, secondly, for Ruth, in terms of the Sites TAC,  I know there are a lot of variables that go into changes in Sites TAC. But when you look at the  puts and takes, how do you see that kind of trending over the next year or two? Thanks. \n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: For us, you know, machine learning plays a critical role across  both the consumer user experience and part of ads, too. You know, generally using machine \n \n\n\n learning to simplify things for our advertisers and make campaigns easier and give them better  insights is where we see a lot of benefit on the Ads side. So, for example, processing complex  data sets and, you know, giving back sophisticated, real-time insights really helps make a  difference. \n\nYou know, and also on the front end, you know, for marketers, helping them find the right  creative for every moment, you know, helping them manage bidding in real-time, and -- so  every step in the consumer journey, I think machine learning is just making things more  efficient, more easier to use and, you know, driving productivity for them. So, you know, that's  what plays out through our systems.  \n\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of the TAC rate, as we've talked about  previously, the growth in mobile does put upward pressure on the Sites TAC rate. And that was  the primary driver of the year-on-year increase in the second quarter. And we do expect the  underlying trend to continue, given the ongoing growth in mobile. \n\nMark May (Citi): Thanks.   \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from  Baird. Your line is now open. \n\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thanks. A couple for me as well. First off, as you embrace more  commerce and payments on the platform, broadly speaking, along with the new Ad formats  you've talked about, can you also talk about what role take-rates might play in terms of future  initiatives and revenue growth? And then, secondly, on Assistant and Duplex, in terms of  near-term search innovation, I wonder if you can characterize how important that is in terms of  the momentum you're seeing, and longer term, how this might impact platform monetization.  Thank you.  \n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on the first question, I think it's a good question.  There's a lot of, you know, discovery that happens across Google's properties, and including  Search and YouTube. And so, you know, anything we can do to make sure users have a better  experience when they are interested in transacting will have a big role. So there's a lot more  work under way to make sure payments work better, sign-in works better, payments works  better. And, you know, all of that, I think, will be -- you know, over the long-term, will be \ndrivers -- drivers, you know, because it improves the overall user experience, especially for  commercial queries. \n\nIn terms of Assistant and Duplex, I mean, you know, look, for us Assistant is where we can  clearly see we can really push our goal of being more helpful to users, helping them get things  done, including things that, you know, matter in the real world. And, you know, so that's what  we are focused on. And if you get that right, you know, just like with Search, you know, there  are many things which users want to get done which do have commercial intent to them. And I  think that's the value creation opportunity as well. \n \n\n But we are focused on making sure the user experience constantly gets better, and we are  investing to get there. \n\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you.  \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of  America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. \n\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Sundar, there's been a lot of regulatory news lately,  especially from the DOJ. Just wondering how you think about a more intense regulatory  environment, getting a lot of questions and wondering if you think about that really affecting  Google operations. And then, Ruth, definitely nice acceleration across the board. Of course,  Europe accelerated as well. When you think about GDPR implementation last year -- and  you're lapping that -- is that helping Europe at all, or was there really no impact from GDPR?  Thank you.  \n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on the regulatory question, we understand there will  be scrutiny. We will engage constructively. It's not new to us. We have participated in these  processes before. Today we do operate under a lot of regulation, be it on privacy, be it on  competition, be it on copyright, intellectual property, et cetera. And even in the U.S., we have  engaged in the process before. To the extent we have to answer questions, we will do so  constructively. And to the extent there are concerns, we'll address them as well. \n\nBut I think for me, it's important that we stay focused on building helpful products to users. And,  you know, that's the value we ultimately provide our users. And I think that's what we will stay  focused on as a company. \n\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of GDPR, we did implement late in the second quarter of 2018. You know, we think it's obviously a critical area, making sure we get it right. That said, the overall impact of regulation on consumers and businesses, you know, is  still playing out. And we're very focused on making sure we're doing what's best for our users  and ensuring we're compliant with the law, not based on any potential revenue impact.  \n\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Thank you.  \nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler  from Barclays. Your line is now open.  \n\n\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Great. If I can squeeze two in real quick. Ruth, the Google  segment operating profit was up 16%. That's the highest growth rate in about two years. So I  guess, how should we think about the cadence of that relative to your comments about  headcount growth and then the Looker acquisition looking forward? And then, Sundar, at I/O,  you mentioned that active Android installed base is now over 2.5 billion. That's up about 10%  year-on-year, and a lot of that coming from emerging markets. So I guess, just big picture, how  do we think about the growth rates that you can sustain in mobile search revenue relative to \n \n\n that 10% active Android growth rate? Thank you.   \nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Yeah, thanks for that. I tried to enumerate the things as we're looking forward, very much to your question. You know, our overall long-term  investment thesis is unchanged. We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing  growth we see across Google, you know, in particular, as we're talking about in Search, while  we're also investing to build new businesses, most notably, in Cloud, as we've talked a lot about here today. \n\nAnd across all of Alphabet, we do continue to benefit from machine learning. That's both opex  and capex. And as we both commented, given the opportunities we see with the application of  machine learning across the business, we are continuing to invest. \n\nYou know, our lens on the pace of investing does have three facets in it. First is investing at the appropriate pace to support long-term earnings growth. And then we -- we're very focused,  second, on optimizing investments within each product area. And, finally, as we've talked  about, investing to support operational excellence.  \n\nBut the megapoint is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing  to invest, which is why in opening comments I wanted to make sure to call out what we're  seeing with respect to ongoing investments in -- across the business, the increases in  headcount and the reasons for them, the benefits of those investments, as well as sales and  marketing and the fact that that is back-half loaded and -- back-half weighted, I should say. So  tried to lay out the relevant points for you to ensure that we make it very clear we are committed to continuing to invest for what we see as the long-term opportunities. \n\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And on the mobile question, you know, we are definitely  investing in Android with the focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile  experience continues to evolve. \n\nIn terms of the mobile experience, I still think, you know, from a user standpoint, there's a lot of  information overload. So being helpful to users and helping them navigate it, be it Search,  Assistant, Maps and YouTube, I think, you know, we are focused on the opportunities there. \n\nAnd in terms of the next billion users, you know, there's a lot of headroom there over time. And  we have focused on -- this is why we take efforts like Android Go seriously. We are constantly  working hard to lower the barrier so that more people can benefit from being online and  participating in the digital economy. And so it will continue to be a focus for us. \n\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for  today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.  \n\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward  to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Thank you and have a good afternoon.  \n", "20193": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q3 2019 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q3 2019 Earnings Call October 28, 2019\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Alphabet third quarter 2019 earnings call. At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you will need to press star and then one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star and then zero. I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s third-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon.\nQ3 was another great quarter at Google, with strong revenue growth driven by mobile search,\nYouTube and Cloud.\nWe celebrated Google\u2019s 21st birthday this quarter. While our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful hasn\u2019t changed, we\u2019ve evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done.\nSince the beginning, we\u2019ve always invested in tackling deep computer science problems that can have a significant impact on society. The chance to be part of these fundamental engineering challenges is why so many people want to work at Google. In just the last week, we\u2019ve announced two significant advances.\nFirst, powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google Search. It\u2019s the biggest leap forward for Search in the past five years. It\u2019s all possible because of a new type of neural-network based technique for natural language processing called BERT, which recognizes subtle patterns in language and provides more relevant results.\nSecond, we recently announced a major quantum computing milestone. I was extraordinarily proud to visit our team in Santa Barbara. To demonstrate supremacy, Google\u2019s 53 qubit\n\n quantum machine, Sycamore, successfully performed a test computation in just 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful supercomputers much longer time to accomplish. It\u2019s the \u201chello-world\u201d moment we have been waiting for and represents a distinct milestone in our effort to harness the principles of quantum mechanics to solve computational problems.\nTurning from quantum to the quarter.\nToday, I\u2019ll talk about the momentum we saw across the business in the last three months. First, Cloud. We saw customer momentum across multiple areas, under Thomas\u2019s leadership.\nIn September, we announced a landmark partnership with Mayo Clinic. Using Google Cloud to secure and store data, and understand insights at scale, Mayo Clinic will partner with us in many ways. Together, we\u2019ll work to transform patient and clinician experiences, identify new methods of diagnosing diseases, conduct clinical research, and find new models for delivering patient care.\nNational Australia Bank recently added Google Cloud to its multi-cloud strategy to help the company better use data and deliver new and improved customer experiences.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group, the 4th largest stock exchange group worldwide, relies on Google Cloud to help them navigate the twin challenge of modernizing their digital operations, and addressing significant regulatory requirements.\nRetailers are also turning to cloud solutions to help make the shopping experience as seamless and personalized as possible. For example, Macy\u2019s uses Google Cloud to streamline their operations from the distribution center to the shop floor.\nPublic sector customers are modernizing their IT systems with Google Cloud with great results. For example, the State of Arizona already has more than 36,000 employees using our products to increase productivity, efficiency and security. And this quarter, it further extended our relationship.\nWe continue to extend our cloud services through partners, including a new solution that enables customers to run VMware workloads on GCP for the first time.\nWe announced a cloud region in Nevada. When it launches in 2020, it will be our seventh cloud region in the U.S. We also announced a new cloud region in Poland, our seventh in Europe.\nTurning to Google\u2019s products that people use every day. We are excited about new features launched in Maps, including detailed voice guidance while walking that will make it possible for people who have vision impairments or are blind to get around more easily, new tools that will allow users to see all of their flight and hotel reservations in one place, and another new feature that gives transit riders in 30 countries the ability to see ridesharing and biking options near their bus or train stop.\n\n In Search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users to find key moments in videos, easily find products within images via Google Lens, and discover new podcasts.\nOur hardware business is still in its early stages, but we are continuing to build the business and a portfolio of helpful products. Two weeks ago, we unveiled our new Made by Google product line-up, bringing together the best of hardware, software and AI.\nOur new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the first phones with Motion Sense. This allows users to use natural gestures to get things done - without touching their phone. The new Google Assistant now gives users the ability to switch seamlessly between apps \u2013 all by voice. And the new Pixelbook Go provides many of the great features of our premium Pixelbook, at a more affordable price point. We also unveiled the new, more powerful Nest Mini speaker and Nest Wifi.\nFinally, the team is looking forward to launching Pixel Buds, our first truly wireless headphones, as well as Stadia, our streaming gaming platform, which will soon be available in the U.S., UK, Canada and throughout Europe. We are encouraged by the positive product reviews so far. With the holidays coming up, I think there\u2019s a gift for everyone on your list.\nOn to YouTube. Keeping YouTube safe for our users, creators and partners while preserving the openness of our platform is our top priority. This quarter, we continued to update our community guidelines and enforcement to protect users from harmful content, and we\u2019ll keep doing this work.\nYouTube Music and YouTube Premium continued to expand globally, and are now available in 71 countries. In September, YouTube launched its new Fashion and Beauty destination, called YouTube/Fashion. It\u2019s designed to meet the growing demand from consumers for better ways to explore and connect with some of YouTube\u2019s biggest Fashion and Beauty creators.\nAnd I want to emphasize that as we build all these helpful products, we\u2019re committed to giving users more control of their data.\nThis quarter, we extended one of our most popular features in Chrome and YouTube, called Incognito Mode, to Maps. We expanded our auto-delete controls to YouTube history. These controls already enable people to set their Location History and Web & App Activity to be deleted automatically after 3 or 18 months. And to protect everyone\u2019s safety online, we introduced Password Checkup. It\u2019s a new feature that tells users if any of their passwords are weak, if they\u2019ve been reused across multiple sites, or if they've been compromised somewhere on the web.\nNow, moving onto how we are helping advertisers.\nWe\u2019re bringing our strengths in machine learning to help advertisers build their ad campaigns.\nMachine learning-powered tools like Search auto-bidding are gaining traction. In fact, more than half of advertisers\u2019 Search spend is now optimized via full auto-bidding. We now have more than a million advertisers using Responsive Search Ads, an ad format we launched a year ago that uses machine learning to create the right ad for each search query. And our new video reach\n\n campaigns allow marketers to upload multiple video ads into a single campaign. From there, we use machine learning to serve the most efficient combination of these ads to help brands reach audiences at scale.\nThis quarter, we expanded inventory for our very popular App campaigns to include new surfaces including YouTube Search, Display video ads and the Discover Feed.\nWe also launched YouTube Masthead Ads for TV, which enable advertisers to reach audiences right when they open the YouTube app on their connected TVs, one of its fastest growing screens.\nIt's also important for advertisers to have standardized measurement that\u2019s fair across all media, and that delivers insights in a way that fully protects users\u2019 privacy. We\u2019re making it easier for businesses to do just that. Our next generation of Google Analytics unifies web and app measurement reporting for the first time to help businesses understand which channel is driving the best results.\nOn a personal note, I was in Dallas in October, where I saw firsthand how important Google is in helping small and medium sized businesses grow. I got to visit Peacock Alley, a bedding and bath manufacturer in Dallas with 75 employees. They\u2019ve been using Google Ads for over 15 years to help drive traffic to their stores. Their e-commerce has grown 52% in the past year. They credit the guidance Google Analytics provides as well as Google Shopping and Product Listing Ads for that growth.\nThis isn\u2019t the only way we help small businesses grow and thrive. Our Grow with Google program has helped train three million Americans in digital skills, including small business owners and entrepreneurs.\nJust a few weeks ago, we announced that our IT Professional Support Certificate training course will expand to 100 community colleges. It\u2019s already helped tens of thousands of people pursue fast-growing, well-paying careers in IT support. I\u2019m glad to see more community colleges offer this pathway to students.\nFinally, to round out a busy quarter.\nSustainability has always been a core value for us, and I\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve been carbon neutral since 2007. In September, we announced the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history. We are increasing Google\u2019s existing renewable energy portfolio by more than 40 percent. These purchases are happening globally, spurring the construction of more than $2 billion in new energy infrastructure, including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines, across three continents. And at our hardware event, we announced that we\u2019re committing to roughly $150 million in renewable energy projects in key manufacturing regions. Our hope is that this will spur even greater investments in sustainability.\nSo it\u2019s been a really great quarter.\n\n A personal highlight for me was our \u201cTake Our Parents to Work Day,\u201d which we held in September at our main campus in Mountain View. It was great to see thousands of parents take such pride in what their kids are building!\nI feel the same way. None of our work would be possible without our Googlers around the world. This quarter was another great example of the mission that brings us all together. Thank you.\nNow, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Sundar. In the third quarter, Total Revenues of $40.5 billion, were up 20% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, YouTube and Cloud. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.\nDetails of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.\nRegarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year.\nOther cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest contributor again this quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; followed by Content acquisition costs - primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising-supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line also includes the impact of hardware costs, primarily associated with our mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.\nOperating expenses were $13.8 billion, with headcount growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and Sales and Marketing, which is reflected in both compensation and facilities expenses.\nWith respect to R&D, the growth was again driven by the addition of engineering talent, consistent with our focus on product innovation.\nThe increase in G&A year-over-year was primarily due to a $554 million charge from our previously announced legal settlement in France.\nStock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion.\nHeadcount was up 6,450 from the second quarter and consistent with prior quarters the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizeable headcount increases were again in Cloud, for both technical and sales roles.\nOperating income was $9.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, for an operating margin of 23%.\n\n Other Income & Expense, was a loss of $549 million, which primarily reflects the impact of unrealized losses in marketable equity securities. As of September 30, the unrealized equity gain in the combined portfolio of marketable and non-marketable securities was $5.8 billion. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.\nNet income was $7.1 billion and earnings per diluted share were $10.12. Turning now to Capex and operating cash flow.\nCash Capex for the quarter was $6.7 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating Cash Flow was $15.5 billion with Free Cash Flow of $8.7 billion. We ended the quarter with Cash & Marketable Securities of approximately $121 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment.\nRevenues were $40.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $28.6 billion in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search.\nNetwork revenues were $5.3 billion, up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within Network, namely Google Ad Manager, followed by AdMob.\nOther revenues for Google were $6.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year, once again fueled by Cloud, followed by a strong performance from Play.\nWithin Cloud, growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products, complemented by ongoing growth in G Suite reflecting both new pricing and seat growth.\nWithin Play, performance was driven once again by growth in the number of active buyers.\nIn addition the line reflects hardware which continued to benefit from the launch of our Pixel 3a mid-tier smartphones.\nWe provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $7.5 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 14% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting primarily a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites. The Sites TAC rate increased year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, partially offset by the growth in TAC-free Sites revenues, primarily from YouTube. In Q3, the Network TAC rate declined year on year, primarily due to a favorable product mix shift.\nGoogle Operating income was $10.9 billion, up 14% versus last year, and the operating margin was 26.9%.\n\n Google Accrued Capex for the quarter was $7.2 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers, followed by servers. Investments in office facilities included the $1 billion acquisition of a portfolio of buildings in Sunnyvale and the purchase of two buildings to expand our presence in the Seattle area.\nMoving on to the performance of Other Bets.\nRevenues were $155 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Other Bets had an Operating Loss of $941 million.\nI\u2019ll note a couple of key accomplishments in Other Bets.\nAt Waymo, we\u2019re extending fully driverless opportunities on a small scale to participants in our early rider program in Metro Phoenix. We\u2019re also testing long-haul truck driving on Arizona freeways. And we are continuing to test Waymo vehicles in various geographies, the newest of which is heavy rain testing in southern Florida. In addition, we have begun 3D mapping in Los Angeles.\nAnd two weeks ago, Wing launched its first commercial drone delivery service to homes in Virginia in partnership with FedEx, Walgreens and local Virginia retailer Sugar Magnolia. Wing is now operating on three continents in early test deliveries.\nI will sum up with a few observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook.\nBased on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the fourth quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a reminder, foreign exchange headwinds affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S.\nWith respect to Revenues, we\u2019re pleased with the performance of our advertising business. As a reminder there is variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates from quarter to quarter. As we\u2019ve often discussed, we manage our business for the long-term and not on a quarterly basis and we remain very focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users and advertisers over the long-term.\nWithin Other Revenues, in addition to continued strength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from data analytics as customers are seeing the benefits from implementing BigQuery. Cloud continued to see significant growth in each region globally.\nOur new line-up of Made by Google Hardware was announced two weeks ago, with Pixel 4 hitting store shelves late last week. With the introduction of the Pixel 3a in the second quarter, we expect the seasonality of our hardware business to be moderated somewhat.\nTurning to elements of our profitability.\nWith regard to Google Operating expenses, while headcount growth on an absolute basis in the third quarter was unusually high, reflecting the addition of new college hires, we do remain on\n\n pace for headcount growth in 2019 to be in line with growth in 2018. Our investments in talent support innovation across our businesses and, in particular, support our ongoing momentum in Cloud.\nRegarding Sales & Marketing expenses, as I\u2019ve mentioned on prior calls, these expenses are typically more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year and tend to be particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season.\nIn Other Bets, we continue to invest meaningfully, and thoughtfully, for the long-term opportunities that we see.\nTurning to capital allocation and capex. With respect to capital returns, consistent with announcing an increase in our stock buyback authorization last quarter to $25 billion, we were pleased to step up repurchase levels by nearly 60% to $5.7 billion in the third quarter.\nIn terms of capex, as a reminder over the last couple of years the split between technical infrastructure and office facilities has averaged approximately 70% to 30%. Due to the sizable purchases of office facilities we made in Q3, technical infrastructure accounted for only about 60% of total capex and continued to be more heavily weighted to data center construction than servers.\nLooking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of Capex investment will continue to be our expected compute requirements, particularly to support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business, as well as for Cloud, Search and YouTube. At this scale of investment, we remain very focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization and tight management of our supply chain.\nIn conclusion, we remain confident about the opportunities ahead. Sundar and I will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. To minimize background noise, we ask that you please mute yourself once your question has been stated. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\nAnd our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. First, Sundar, a big-picture question, it feels like the concept of ambient computing was sort of prevalent at the Made by Google event recently. It started with sort of a bit of a shift in theme, from what I could tell, at Google I/O earlier this year. Can you just talk about what some of the key investments you want to make to capitalize on that opportunity over the medium to longer term and how you think Google and, maybe broader, Alphabet is positioned to capitalize on that and how it might show up at the product and services layer. So I guess maybe a three-part question of more of a bigger-picture nature. Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Eric. We are very excited by the vision of ambient\n\n computing and evolving that. I think it's a continuity in the sense that, over time, computing should be more intuitive to users and computing should adapt to users, not the other way around.\nAnd the foundations of all this is all the work we have done with our computing platforms to date and the successful consumer services and the developer platforms we have built. And I think that's the -- most of the investments there.\nThe phones will continue to be at the center of ambient computing for the future. So that's another important piece where we are already invested in.\nI think as we expand beyond, and that's what the Made by Google family is focused on, products in your home, with our Nest family of products and wearables, which we do with Wear OS and so on. So supporting that ecosystem, so whether you are at home or on the go or at work, and making sure it works.\nOur investments in AI across the company I think will end up playing a key role, AI and Assistant. I think they will be at the center of making sure we can anticipate what users want and serve them better.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you talked about the new neural network techniques, talked about the biggest breakthrough in Search in years. Can you just help us understand if that's impacting kind of the advertising and monetization side of the business yet or how that can play out going forward? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Anytime -- maybe I'll answer it as BERT, which is the name of the technique we are using, and we have rolled it out in Search now. Obviously, anytime we can better make sense of queries, we can serve users better, our search quality goes up and people engage more. So it's part of a long run set of things we've been working on.\nBut this is one of our bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the Search experience and search quality. And remember it will help us in a certain set of queries. There are many queries which are already working well, but it helps us capture nuance and help understand human context better.\nAnd so I would just characterize this as a big improvement which improves search quality and creates that virtuous cycle by which people engage more. Of course, a lot of times we take the same techniques, and sometimes it makes sense on the ads side and the underlying machine learning techniques. And we'll deploy there as well.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\n Heather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you so much. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you made about Cloud, Sundar. I was wondering if you can just give us some color on the size of your GCP backlog. And maybe even if you just talk about the trajectory and how that's changed over the course of the last year. And then you mentioned the strength and the uptake of BigQuery. I'm just trying to think through how we should think of the margin level of a service like this versus the traditional compute offerings where you have seen strength to date and just wondering if we start to see some positive mix-shift benefits as some of these premium products start to ramp more aggressively. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Thanks, Heather. Overall, I know we gave some visibility into our Cloud business, and we'll continue to do that periodically. And the momentum has been great. Obviously, ever since Thomas has come in, he has continued to invest across the board. We have definitely focused a lot on scaling up our sales partner and operational teams, and it's playing out well in this business. It's important for you to be in as many deal situations as possible and get those wins, which accrues over time. And so we are definitely seeing the momentum.\nAnalytics is a huge area of strength for us, and it's an area which Thomas has a lot of expertise in as well. And BigQuery is such a strong product, so it's a natural area we are seeing strength.\nAnd my sense is, as we get -- if I look at the TAM -- the percentage of TAM for which we were eligible compared to two years ago to last year to now, that number is shifting aggressively due to either completing our product feature set or be it completing some of the certifications we need. And so I think there are several strong forward-looking indicators, and look forward to sharing more at the right time.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC\nCapital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Can I just ask you to draw a little bit more out on Google Maps. I know that's -- from Marketing Live earlier in the year, that seems like that\u2019s now at a stage where it's going to be better integrated into the -- I don't know, the purchase path or whatever. You're making it easier for small businesses to tap into what should be really nicely qualified leads. Just talk about the pace at which that -- the monetization of that or just the ad opportunities will be offered to small businesses. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: In general, local is an important area for us, and we are continuing to invest in building an experience that connects merchants, advertisers, and users. Google My Business has been our major effort there. Today, millions of businesses reach and engage both through Search and Maps.\nSpecifically, in GML, we announced that we'll expand Local Campaigns. I presume that's what you're talking about. You know, it's still early. And, in general, we want to make it easier for advertisers, particularly SMBs, to come to Google and be able to reach users across our set of owned and operated properties, so be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Discover, be it Maps. And that's the way we envision that. And -- but small and medium business is a big area of focus,\n\n and Maps represents a big long-term opportunity for us.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And just to add on there, given you referenced back to GML -- and I think we talked about this last quarter as well -- our view is that the products that were introduced at GML this year, like in previous years, they're rolled out in phases. They're adopted over time. And so we don't view the potential impact from this year's slate differently than the impact from products that were launched at previous events. And so just to kind of keep that in perspective.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from\nDeutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nLloyd Walmsley (Deutsche Bank): Thanks. I wanted to ask another one about a new product you guys announced earlier this year at GML, and that was really Google Shopping, and moving that across some of the new -- different properties like YouTube and Image Search and Discover. Can you give us a sense for where you are in that migration? Kind of over what time frame should we be thinking about that? And then maybe just elaborate a bit on the long-term vision of moving Shopping functionality into properties like YouTube and how you think that experience will evolve. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: In general, I think it's a great opportunity for us. We see tons of what I would call commercial user journeys across Google. Obviously, Search is an important area, Image Search, YouTube, Maps are all great surfaces by which I think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest, looking to discover and at times transact as well.\nSo, you know, we've started thinking much more holistically about what are those experiences and how can we make that better. That involves helping improve the discovery experience, but when people are interested in it, being able to be -- to make it easier to transact. So the equivalent of being signed in and being able to pay when you want and then, of course, fulfillment and logistics. So we are thinking through the end-to-end experience across all our surfaces and are investing. But I see the user interest, and it's an area where I think we have significant opportunities ahead.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And, again, these are still earlier stage, and it's -- we're excited about the longer-term impact. But just to, again, make it clear, we're just still in the earlier stages of testing.\nLloyd Walmsley (Deutsche Bank): Okay. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from\nMorgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my question today. I have two. Ruth, I think you mentioned that desktop search might have been one of the contributors of growth. Can you just talk to us a little bit about what types of products or verticals you're still seeing growth in on desktop search, it's really impressive, given how old, how long it has been around.\n\n And then, Sundar, with all the exciting changes going on with Search, becoming more relevant, et cetera, can you just talk to us about some of the KPIs that you monitor and what you're seeing when it comes to query volumes, click-through rates, overall response times. What are you seeing that sort of gives you confidence that you are continuing to get more and more relevant results for your users? Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of desktop, you know, I described it as a solid contributor to revenue growth. And what we see is that desktop does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks. So things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options, what we see is users continue to go back to desktop, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. And I think one of the things that we\u2019ve been very focused on is that innovations that benefit mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: And then in terms of -- obviously, we've been -- over time, we have developed a very comprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search -- search quality -- to get a sense of search quality and how user satisfaction is through Search. But to give you a sense of -- we continue -- continue to take that work deeper, we realize users sometimes do searches through sessions, understanding what is their satisfaction across a session, what is their engagement. Are they getting at what they are looking for? Those are all some of the deeper work we are undertaking.\nAnd also understanding by vertical how we are helping users. There was an earlier question around shopping and commerce. That's an example of the kind of vertical and what can we do to make that experience better. Health is a vertical, another vertical, in which we have a whole Google Health team focused on understanding the in-depth experience that would give a better experience overall on Search.\nSo it's a very comprehensive effort, and we are constantly looking to do it deeper and broader at the same time.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from\nBaird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you. I have two. Sundar, there's clearly a lot of innovation happening at Google. But I'm wondering, how do you think about the increase in scrutiny and oversight possibly impacting your ability to explore new services or new markets over time, and ultimately, to remain competitive? And, second, Sundar or Ruth, we don't often ask about the Display Network, but just wondering, given all the concerns around privacy, ad blocking, the like, how do you view this business strategically as part of the overall ecosystem? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, on the first part, we consistently want to work and build products that benefit users and support the ecosystem. And so our products and services benefit consumers, small and medium businesses, advertisers. And, overall, they help reduce prices and expand choice. And so that's our underlying approach, I think, which is what helps us engage and explain to regulators. And we'll continue to do that.\n\n You know, I think there are also many new areas of opportunities available for us. And in many of these areas, we are the new entrant and we create competition. And sometimes the competitive pressures can lead to concerns from others. And so that's part of what's going on as well.\nBut the other area is innovation to develop markets. We are investing deeply in our next billion users, so markets like APAC continue to be big long-term opportunities for us as well.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Great. Ruth, just if you rewind the clock a little bit, when we entered this year, you had called out how some product changes may cause year-over-year growth rates to fluctuate from time to time. And we haven't heard that in a couple of quarters. So as we look out towards, like, 2020 and beyond, do you feel like a lot of the product queue is in a good place as far as Search and YouTube are concerned and that, these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward? Or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future? Just any color there. And then on the third quarter, the Asia region, the growth rate was solid but a tad lower than the prior trend. So anything notable to call out on APAC? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of the first question, look, I think as Sundar and I have talked about, we're pleased with the strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter. And as we've said since the IPO, we don't manage the business to maximize quarterly results and we'll always do the right thing for the long-term. We're very focused on investing for the long-term.\nAnd I tried to make it clear in the opening comments that as a result, quarterly growth can vary and has varied. I think, to your question, our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you've seen since the beginning of the year for us underscore the strength and the vibrancy, actually, in our business.\nAnd, you know, that's particularly true at our size. In the last 12 months, we've generated over $150 billion in total revenues. That's about $25 billion of growth in the last year. And we are continuing to invest in long-term opportunities. But I would make the point that we do keep a lens to the long-term.\nIn terms of your question about geographies, when we look at the performance on a fixed-FX basis around the globe, pleased with the performance again in the third quarter. You aptly point out year-on-year growth in APAC in the third quarter was a bit lower than the second quarter. That primarily reflected slower growth in the Network business. And that was, in part, due to policy changes. It also reflected the fact that the launch of the Pixel 3a was in the second quarter, which boosted the year-on-year growth rate in the second quarter.\nBut I think also implicit in your question, at 26% year-on-year growth on a fixed-FX basis, running at about now $7 billion in quarterly revenues, we're really pleased with all that the team is doing and the year-on-year growth rate.\n\n Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on the Discover feed. That's a new product that we've featured in the past that I know a lot of users are getting more use out of. You've given us, I think, some updates on monthly active users, or DAUs, in the past. Any update there would be great or maybe any additional color on sort of how the total amounts of usage goes on there. That's obviously been featured to users a little bit more. And then, second, maybe just a follow-up for Ruth. Sundar spoke at length about your investments in renewable energy earlier. And maybe, keeping with the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping drive efficiencies across the country -- or across the company and your operating costs overall. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: Discover is a product we are very excited about. I think it completes the other half of Search. Search is -- we do our mission for our users and be helpful when they come to us looking for information. Discover is the other half, where we are proactively understanding what might be most helpful or relevant to them and getting it to them.\nAnd we definitely are focused on product quality and making sure the product is actually helpful to users and when they engage with it, they find it useful.\nAnd it's definitely -- we are making progress. Our investments in machine learning are helping as well. We are definitely able to better anticipate and give them information proactively.\nSo over time, I see it as an important area for us. And it's done in close -- it's part of our Search and Knowledge efforts. And, as we do that, you can imagine you may have started a query in Search and it's a session. Maybe you're looking to take a trip somewhere or you're researching a particular topic. We may be able to continue that session and the user journey in Discover. And that creates a virtuous cycle. So these are -- we want to be helpful to users in a way that makes sense for them more continually. And the combination of Search and Discover helps us do that.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of your question on sustainability, we're proud of the work that we're doing. We do think that it's a valuable part of what we do. And we do consider the impact on the business and on the financials.\nIt really cuts across every element of what we do, what we're doing in our technical infrastructure, the way we're thinking about our products, as Sundar talked about, what we do with our facilities, what we're doing with AI. And I think it was about a year ago we talked about how we were applying machine learning to energy efficiency in our data centers. And it did have a net benefit. It helped us reduce energy consumption, not only positive for sustainability but was an efficiency effort.\nSundar talked about the fact that we are investing -- recently announced that we are purchasing -- making a meaningful investment in renewable energy, part of our commitment to offset 100% of our electricity use with renewables. And in our view, this is catalyzing further investment in renewables.\n\n That is going to have a modest short-term increase in cost, but we think it's beneficial to catalyzing the overall growth in traditional [sic] energy. So there are puts and takes, net-net. We're proud of the work across everything that we're doing to support sustainability.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is\nnow open.\nAgain, Brent, your line is now open. Please check your mute button.\nAnd our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Okay. Thank you. So, Sundar, was wondering if you can put the quantum computing advancement into some sort of perspective. I mean, the compute needs for Google has to be exponentially higher versus when you first launched. So we're wondering if this helps you get your arms around that ever-increasing compute need. And, further, I think you'll find that investors are as impatient as you guys are for progress. So can you talk about what kind of products or services this will help you create that you otherwise couldn't even think about doing before. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: We're incredibly proud of the work that the team did and excited about the advancement in the whole industry. I think,in general, obviously, we've relied on advances in computing to be able to do what we do. And when we look ahead, we definitely see being able to drive the pace of change fastest is an important need for us as well as, I think, a source of competitive advantage.\nAs Moore's Law effects have diminished, I think, we are looking at a variety of approaches to make sure we can continue doing what we need to. And in that, this is an important tool in the arsenal. While quantum will take many years to really start making a difference, we want to be at the cutting edge of driving it.\nI do think over time for sure, Cloud itself, we do see a lot of interest from Cloud customers, particularly in cutting-edge verticals, about quantum computing. And so that's an area where I think we will participate in as a business. And more importantly, applying it across other verticals we are in, be it health, as an example, I think will be where we will deliver value in the long run.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And as much as we're extremely excited about the long-term implications for quantum computing, part of your question there about our near-term computing requirements, given our outlook in particular across Google, we do expect to see ongoing demand for compute investments to support our growth, particularly for machine learning, Cloud, Search and YouTube. And the primary driver of capex does continue to be our expectations for compute requirements, so investments in technical infrastructure, as we've talked about today.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.\n\n Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks. I need a Google headset. Sundar, just on investments in GCP, you're in a really unique situation, having both infrastructure and productivity applications. Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways you can go in GCP. And just wanted to follow up with Ruth. You alluded to some G Suite pricing changes. And I know there was some prices that were changed earlier in the year. And I was just curious if you were referring to that price change earlier in the year or if there was something new. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: I mean, you're right. I mean, these are two big buckets, and we treat them that way. Obviously, we have talked a lot about GCP. But G Suite continues to be very differentiated. And, we just announced a new leader, Javier Soltero, coming in with lots of experience to turbocharge this area as well.\nAnd, in general, there are many G Suite customers now with whom we are having GCP conversations and vice versa. So I think, in general, given we have a big go-to-market effort, the breadth you have allows us to have more conversations and engage through many different paths in the organization. So it's very synergistic as well.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of the G Suite pricing, I was referencing the pricing that we announced back in April. It's all outlined in a blog post. Our view was that it was the right time to increase prices, given the ongoing functionality and tools that are included within G Suite. And, as I said, what we're seeing here is in addition to the benefit from the price change, we also continue to have nice seat growth.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post\nfrom Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (BoA-Merrill Lynch): Great. Thanks. I think I'll ask on YouTube. Could you talk a little bit about your high-level OTT viewing strategy? Obviously, subscriptions are growing. And maybe give us an update on how your YouTube subscription product is doing versus expectations. And then on the paid click growth, it decelerated 18%. Anything to call out there, especially related to YouTube? Any change to coverage going on or anything we should know about? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Google: You know, subscriptions is an area we are definitely excited about. You know, we are pleased with the adoption so far across both YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. They're now available in 71 countries, up from five markets at the start of 2018. So we are definitely scaling that up, and we are seeing great traction.\nYouTube TV is also doing well. I think we just announced that PBS is coming to YouTube TV in July. Last month, we announced YouTube TV is now launching on select Amazon Fire TV devices. So there is definite -- the user satisfaction on the product is very high, and so we are\n\n focused on continuing our expansion, building out a great service and building awareness for the service.\nSo, overall, I think engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube is a focus for us. And the efforts, while early, are definitely showing strong traction.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then you asked about click growth and the trend there. The biggest driver affecting the click trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement ads. As in the first and second quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. That does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and advertiser experience. And as we've talked about on prior calls, that did have an impact on click growth.\nBut as we also talked about, they weren't related to -- those changes in 2018 were not related to policy enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. So not a read-through.\nJustin Post (Bank of America-Merrill Lynch):  Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today.\nI'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Thank you, again, and have a good evening.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.", "20194": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q4 2019 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q4 2019 Earnings Call February 3, 2020\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Alphabet fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you will need to press star and then one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star then zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s fourth-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat.\nNow I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.\nAnd now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon, everyone.\nIt\u2019s a privilege to join the call as the CEO of both Alphabet and Google, after four years as CEO of Google.\nI\u2019d like to start by thanking Larry and Sergey for giving all of us at Google a timeless mission, enduring values and an opportunity to have an impact on the world.\nThere\u2019s a lot I want to cover today and I also want to leave plenty of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth.\nAs you\u2019ve seen in our press release, we\u2019ve added new revenue disclosures to give greater insight into our business.\nSearch and other Google properties continue to drive great results, with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth. I\u2019m also really pleased with two of our newer growth areas.\n\n YouTube reached $15 billion in ads revenues in 2019, growing at 36% compared with 2018. And it now has over 20 million Music and Premium paid subscribers, and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers -- ending 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other non-advertising revenues.\nGoogle Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year driven by significant growth in GCP. The growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall and GCP\u2019s growth rate accelerated from 2018 to 2019.\nBefore I talk about the highlights of the quarter, I want to take a step back and give some early thoughts about my approach to managing Alphabet and the Other Bets.\nWe have always taken a long term view, investing in deep computer science and technology. Important trends like the wider adoption and application of artificial intelligence, ambient computing and the move to the Cloud, underline our investments across Google and our other Alphabet companies.\nOur work in healthcare is a great example of how our investments in these areas allows us to deliver solutions across an entire sector:\nGoogle Cloud works with hospitals and healthcare providers to securely manage their patients\u2019 data - data that is much more secure in the Cloud than in paper records or on premises.\nOur AI teams at Google also work with partners to apply AI to help them and their patients -- whether it\u2019s developing better health systems, or helping with the diagnosis and detection of disease.\nAmong their broader efforts, our Other Bets Verily and Calico are also partnering with industry leaders, to use AI and cloud technologies to improve clinical trials, research and drug development.\nOur thesis has always been to apply these deep computer science capabilities across Google and our Other Bets to grow and develop into new areas. The Alphabet structure allows us to have a portfolio of different businesses with different time horizons, without trying to stretch a single management team across different areas. We will continue to take a long term view, managing the portfolio with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns.\nMany of our Other Bets are getting to the stage where it now makes sense for them to partner closely with other players and investors in the industry.\nWaymo's technological leadership is widely reported - its cars have driven 20 million miles across more than 25 U.S. cities. Waymo is now serving over 1,500 monthly active riders in Metro Phoenix and continues scaling fully driverless by matching early riders with driverless vehicles and charging for these rides.\nAs Waymo looks to its evolution as a business, it\u2019s focusing on strategic partnerships - for example it\u2019s working closely with OEMs and other businesses to build out ride-hailing and delivery business lines.\n\n And Verily is an example of a company in the portfolio that has outside investors, Silver Lake and Temasek, as well as its own Board. We\u2019ll consider opportunities for some of our Other Bets to take similar steps over time.\nNow, onto highlights from the quarter.\nFirst, Search and the Related Google properties.\nAs I mentioned on our last call, our neural-network based technique for natural language processing, called BERT, is the biggest advancement in Search in the last five years. It now impacts 10% of searches. And in Q4, we rolled it out in over 70 languages.\nIn Maps, we are celebrating our 15th anniversary very soon and in the past year we brought reliable directions to 630 million additional people in locations that previously weren't well mapped. We added as many buildings to maps using ML in 2019 as we have added using all techniques in the previous decade. With all these improvements, user growth is strong and the range of things people are doing with Google Maps continues to expand as well.\nThe Google Assistant now helps more than 500 million monthly users across 90 countries get things done - across smart speakers and smart displays, phones, TVs, cars and more.\nShopping and commerce is another exciting area. We\u2019re making strong leadership hires in this area to help build a thriving business for partners of all sizes. Over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday weekend, we had the largest number of daily shoppers on Google.com ever in our history. Throughout the entire holiday shopping season, we also expanded the selection of products on Google due to a 4x uptick in the number of US merchants participating in our Shopping Actions program.\nSecond, YouTube.\nSpeaking of shopping, people can now easily buy products in YouTube\u2019s home feed and in search results, making it possible for advertisers to reach even more audiences. Try searching for \u201cPuma shoes review\u201d on YouTube to see an example. With all the related content on YouTube like unboxing and beauty videos, this is a format people love and it delivers a simple in-video buying experience.\nA huge focus is continuing our work to keep YouTube safe for users, creators and advertisers. You may have seen a blog post today about our work to promote authoritative content and remove misleading information about the upcoming 2020 elections. For example, we\u2019re applying our deceptive content policies to reduce misleading information about voting locations or the census process.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re pleased with YouTube\u2019s growth in advertising and subscriptions -- and we also are pleased with the early results from other revenue options we offer creators, including memberships, brand integrations, merchandise and ticket sales.\nContinuing on now to Cloud.\n\n We\u2019re really pleased with the momentum we\u2019re seeing in Cloud. Year on year, the number of deals over $50 million more than doubled.\nThe investments in Cloud\u2019s go-to-market expansion are resulting in customer momentum. Wayfair is one of the many retailers, who successfully ran holiday operations on Google Cloud. In addition, Lowe\u2019s, which began transitioning off its legacy e-commerce system in late 2018 to Google Cloud, worked with us during this year\u2019s peak holiday buying season to improve the stability of their e-commerce site.\nWorth noting, at peak time, customers in our Black Friday/Cyber Monday program used 4x the compute resources compared to previous year, and our platform experienced 100% uptime.\nLufthansa Group is using our AI solutions to develop new tools that will improve air travel operations. The U.S. Postal Service also chose Google Cloud AI to improve business processes and customer experience.\nWe\u2019ve recently signed a 10 year agreement with Sabre to help them improve operations and develop new airline and hospitality services.\nFinally, Google Other Revenue.\nAndroid continues to thrive. I\u2019m proud to announce that over $80 billion has been earned by developers around the world from Google Play, showing the popularity of our platform. There are now over 2 billion active monthly users of Google Play.\nHardware is still in the early stages of delivering on our vision for ambient computing. Our Home devices demonstrate how this vision can come to life in creating the home of the future, with our new Nest Mini and Nest Hub Max selling well over the holidays, following on from the Pixel 3A which sold well last year. With Pixel 4, we continued to build out our capabilities and are keenly focused on execution, delivering great user experiences and broadening our distribution. And our pending acquisition of Fitbit will give us a foundation in wearables. I\u2019m excited about our roadmap ahead across our products.\nOverall in 2020, our teams at Google are focusing on four key things.\nFirst, creating the most helpful products for everyone. We\u2019re really focused on ensuring that our products like Search, Maps and the Assistant are helping people in their daily lives.\nSecond, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. We\u2019re doing lots of work to keep improving users\u2019 privacy and security, while also keeping harmful content off our systems.\nThird, executing at scale. This will show up as more seamless products across various surfaces and platforms, like the Google Assistant, deeper partnerships, and better use of our shared infrastructure. For example, Activision Blizzard recently chose Google as a strategic partner, using Google Cloud\u2019s computing infrastructure, YouTube for live streaming and our AI tools. Putting together these multi-product partnerships helps us unlock great opportunities for our partners.\n\n And fourth, creating sustainable value. This means optimizing our usage of computing resources, and also growing business opportunities in areas like YouTube, Cloud, Play, Hardware and beyond.\nSo as you can see, there\u2019s a lot happening at the company, and a real sense of excitement and focus. I want to thank our employees for all the great work in 2019. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ruth and I look forward to your questions.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Sundar. We\u2019re very pleased with our strong 2019 results, with Total Alphabet Revenues of $162 billion, up 18% year-on-year, or 20% in constant currency. In dollar terms, this represents an increase of $25 billion in revenues relative to 2018.\nI will review our quarterly and annual results, including our new revenue disclosures, and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.\nStarting with consolidated Alphabet results, in the fourth quarter our total revenues were $46.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year, and up 19% in constant currency. Our results were driven by ongoing strength in Search, YouTube and Google Cloud, offset by a decline in Hardware revenues.\nDetails of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.\nRegarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $21.0 billion, up 17% year-on-year.\nOther cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $12.5 billion, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.\nThe biggest factors here, again this quarter, were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; and then content acquisition costs - primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising-supported content in what has been a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services, as well as YouTube TV, which have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of their revenues; these were partially offset by a decline in costs associated with lower hardware sales.\nOperating expenses were $15.8 billion, with headcount growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for R&D and sales and marketing expenses. Headcount drives both compensation and related facilities expenses.\nAfter headcount growth, the biggest driver in R&D expenses was an increase in valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets.\nStock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion.\n\n Headcount was up 4,803 from the third quarter and up 20% over 2018. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud, for both technical and sales roles including the impact of the Looker acquisition which closed in December.\nOperating income was $9.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year, for an operating margin of 20%.\nOther Income & Expense, was $1.4 billion, which primarily reflects an increase in the market value of certain publicly traded equities, as well as a non-cash gain from a Verily transaction. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.\nOur effective tax rate was 0.3% for the fourth quarter and was 13% for the full year. The fourth quarter ETR reflects the impact of discrete items, including the resolution of multi-year audits. As you have seen in prior years, ETR can vary on a quarterly basis.\nNet income was $10.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $15.35.\nTurning now to Capex and operating cash flow. Cash Capex for the quarter was $6.0 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating Cash Flow was $14.4 billion with Free Cash Flow of $8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with Cash & Marketable Securities of approximately $120 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results.\nStarting with the Google segment, Revenues were $45.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year and this, of course, is on a GAAP or floating FX basis.\nGoogle search and other advertising revenues were $27.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year reflecting ongoing momentum in mobile and desktop.\nYouTube advertising revenues were $4.7 billion, up 31% year-on-year, driven by substantial growth in Direct Response and ongoing healthy growth in Brand advertising which remains the largest component.\nNetwork advertising revenues were $6.0 billion, up 8% year-on-year, led by growth in Google Ad Manager.\nTurning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite, revenues were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, up 53% year-over-year, driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth at G Suite.\nThe growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall. GCP growth was led by our Infrastructure offerings and our Data and Analytics platform. We also saw strong uptake of our multi-Cloud Anthos offering.\nOngoing growth in G Suite continued to reflect growth in both SMB and Enterprise segments and both seat count and average revenue per seat.\n\n The Other Revenues line now consists of Google Play, followed by Hardware and YouTube\u2019s non-advertising services, mainly its subscription offerings, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music and YouTube TV.\nIn the fourth quarter, Other Revenues were $5.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play, offset by declines in Hardware. YouTube\u2019s contribution to Other Revenues benefited from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues had strong growth, driven by an increase in the number of active buyers.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $8.5 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 14% year-over-year.\nTotal TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting once again a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Google Properties.\nGoogle Operating income was $11.5 billion, up 20% versus last year, and the operating margin was 25%.\nGoogle Accrued Capex for the quarter was $6.6 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, followed by servers and office facilities.\nMoving on to the performance of Other Bets.\nFor the full year 2019, revenues were $659 million, up 11% vs. 2018, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily.\nOperating Loss for Other Bets was $4.8 billion for the full year 2019, versus an operating loss of $3.4 billion in 2018.\nLet me conclude with a few observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook.\nBased on the strength of the US dollar to date relative to the first quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the first quarter of 2020.\nWith our expanded revenue disclosures this quarter, I\u2019ll talk about the revenue and investment outlook for each of these newly disclosed component parts.\nFirst, with respect to Search and other advertising, although we don\u2019t report Search revenues on a fixed FX basis, the delta between fixed & floating growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on Search revenues, or a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points in 2019.\nAt our scale, we are pleased with our rate of growth for 2019 and see ample opportunity going forward. What\u2019s exciting for us as we look ahead at Search and other Google properties, is the ongoing opportunity to support users and advertisers with new ads experiences and improved measurement.\nSecond, with respect to YouTube advertising, at a year on year growth rate of more than 30% in 7\n\n the fourth quarter, we\u2019re pleased with the ongoing strength and opportunity at YouTube. We see substantial continuing opportunity in direct response as well as with brand advertisers.\nAs Sundar shared earlier, the non-advertising services at YouTube, mainly from subscriptions, reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest across YouTube to grow over the long-term.\nIn the ad-supported portion of YouTube, we pay out a majority of revenues to our creators, reflected in our content acquisition costs. On top of that there are other expenses, including infrastructure and networking costs, as well as the costs of our content responsibility efforts to keep YouTube safe for users, creators and advertisers.\nWe\u2019re also investing meaningfully to grow our subscriptions, which have higher content acquisition cost ratios.\nTurning next to Google Cloud, we are very confident that there is an enormous opportunity here that plays to our core strengths.\nWe\u2019re pleased with the growth trajectory of GCP -- which we see in customer momentum, the growing size of the average contract and of course, revenues. The traction we\u2019re having with large customers who are making multi-year commitments with us is reflected in our backlog, which ended the year at $11.4 billion, substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud.\nGiven our position as a challenger, we\u2019re investing aggressively, focused on building out our go-to-market capabilities, executing against our product roadmap and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure, focused on 21 markets and 6 industries.\nIn terms of Hardware, as Sundar noted in his opening remarks, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity with ambient computing.\nWe believe our strengths in AI and software give us an advantage in providing seamless experiences to users wherever they are across multiple surfaces.\nWe have been investing heavily in developing our capabilities in hardware engineering, as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains and we\u2019ve created a multi-billion dollar revenue business in the past three years.\nWe\u2019re looking forward to our acquisition of Fitbit, which will add strong capabilities in Wearables and advance our vision of ambient computing for the Android ecosystem.\nAs we look at the near term product roadmap, we continue to execute at a measured pace.\nIn Other Bets, we are sharpening our focus on the metrics and milestones against which capital allocation is determined and we continue to assess where external capital is additive to governance and execution.\nI\u2019ll now turn to the investments we are making in headcount and in capex to support the growth opportunities we see across Alphabet.\n\n With respect to headcount, in 2019, Alphabet headcount grew by 20%, reflecting investment in key areas such as Cloud. Overall, we expect the growth rate of headcount to be slightly higher in 2020 due to the combined impact of investment in priority areas, plus the decision to move certain vendor functions in-house, as well as from the planned impact of the Fitbit acquisition. On SBC, as a reminder, our full year equity refresh grants are made to employees during the first quarter of 2020 and you will see the step-up in our first quarter results.\nIn terms of Capex, in 2020, we intend to increase our investment in both Technical Infrastructure and office facilities vs. 2019.\nWithin Technical Infrastructure, the investments in particular support ongoing demand for Machine Learning across our business, as well as for Cloud, Search, Ads and YouTube. Relative to 2019, we anticipate relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction.\nAt this scale of investment, we remain very focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization and tight management of our supply chain.\nFinally, on capital returns, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $6.1 billion of shares, which was more than double the amount of repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of year end, we had $21 billion remaining in the program and are focused on executing on the remaining authorization at a pace that is at least consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter.\nIn conclusion, we remain very confident about the opportunities across Alphabet and in our ability to continue to deliver at the steady pace we have shown.\nSundar and I will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star and then 1 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key.\nTo prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated.\nAnd our first question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Hi. Thank you very much, Sundar and Ruth. And I guess -- I'm sure we're going to hear this a million times tonight. But thank you so much for the enhanced disclosure. I think this is the best Google call -- or Alphabet call I've been on since I covered the company. So thank you, again. You\u2019ve given us a lot of stuff here.\nI just wanted to focus a little bit on GCP and the comments that you made. Either if you want to think about this for Google Cloud collectively or just for GCP, just given the revenue run rate that you're at, how do we think about the gross margin profile of this business? Is it fair to look at some of the other Cloud players when they were disclosing similar run rates to get a sense of what their gross margins were? Or is there a reason why your business might look slightly\n\n different? Thank you so much again.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: Thank you for those comments.\nSo, first and foremost, we're obviously really pleased with the momentum here. GCP had fantastic revenue momentum in the fourth quarter and, as we noted, is growing at a meaningfully higher pace than Google Cloud overall.\nIn terms of your margin question, you know, look, I think our view is obviously the competitive dynamics in the Cloud market are very different today. We are investing aggressively, given the opportunity which I tried to make clear in opening comments.\nGiven the opportunity we see and the momentum we're having, we've accelerated our investment in our go-to-market team. And as we've talked about before, we've set a goal to triple the size of the sales force. We're also focused on building out our product roadmap and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure.\nAnd I\u2019ll leave the forecasting to you.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks so much. Maybe two parts, if I can. Sundar, for you first. A lot of innovation the company put on display over the past year. Ruth talked in her sort of forward commentary section about sustainability of growth and outperformance going forward. What are you most excited about when you see the company trying to align what improves consumer utility along with what continues to drive growth in the various segments of the business? That would be number one. And, two, Ruth, maybe for you, you had talked about variability of revenue last quarter going into Q4. Unless I missed it, I don't think you used the same word again in Q4. What were you expecting in terms of variability in Q4? And any color you could give on how that played out or how we should be thinking about variability of revenue going forward? Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: Eric, I think overall I presume you mean across everything we do. And if that's the case -- I mean, the trends we are seeing -- and you -- we have been investing on it for a while, but applying it and actually driving use cases to users. So, for example, using AI to dramatically improve natural language processing to make 10% of our Search results better is a kind of opportunity I'm excited by.\nWhen I look at -- we do see a lot of commercial experiences across our properties, be it Search or YouTube, and the opportunity to create a better experience there and, hence, bring more value to our users. That's something which we see as a big opportunity.\n\n And across our businesses, be it YouTube, Cloud, Play, or Hardware, in addition to Search, we are seeing strength in a lot of these areas. And we share a common technological approach across all of them. And so that gives us a synergistic way to approach these areas as well.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: And then on your second question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate of growth in 2019 here in Search and our Ads business overall. We do see ample opportunity ahead.\nWhen we talk about variability of revenue, the way we've talked about it in the past very much holds true, which is we're -- we don't manage for any particular quarter. We manage focused on what's in the best -- best for users and with a lot of testing that goes around it.\nAnd so really the point is there will be variability. And we're focused on the continued long-term opportunity, and we do see that opportunity -- the Ads opportunity to be significant. Apart from the secular shift to digital, we continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience. Our view is that all helps grow the addressable market, but there will be variability over time because we are very focused on what's in the right long-term interest.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, first, just hoping you could talk more about Google Cloud. Great to see the $10 billion run rate. Just curious if you can help gauge the progress over the past year. Where do you think the biggest areas of differentiation lie in an increasingly competitive space? And then, Ruth, can you just give some of your latest thoughts on balancing growth and profitability across the Google segment and Other Bets? And as you enter this year, do you see additional opportunities to drive increased profitability without impacting the long-term potential of the businesses? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: Doug, on Cloud, I think maybe a few thoughts on some of the progress we made last year and talk about the differentiation, which you asked about as well.\nDefinitely, under Thomas's leadership, I think we have clearly focused on six industry verticals across 21 markets, so doubling down on those efforts, bringing in a lot of new products and compliance certifications, so effectively expanding the TAM which we serve.\nRuth mentioned the team is on track to triple our sales force in three years, including bringing in a number of senior strategic hires and supplementing it with the channel partnership program.\n\n I think the progress I've seen in our customer focus with our customer success organization and the contracting framework have all been great progress for us.\nOverall, every time we are in, especially one of these larger deals, they are effectively looking for a technology partner. So differentiation is not just what we bring to table in terms of Cloud, where we have differentiated capabilities, but in many cases it's what we bring as Google, so if you take an area like healthcare, all the investments we are making in healthcare across Google and in some cases Alphabet. If you look at Sabre, the partnership we can bring to them across our experience working in travel verticals as well.\nSo I think -- and over time, I also think the AI-based industry-specific solutions we are working on will end up being a differentiating factor as well.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: And in terms of your second question, investing for growth and how we balance growth and profitability, the approach to capital allocation and the pace of investing continues to be guided by the same three drivers that we've talked about previously. First, and most important, is investing to support the long-term earnings growth and the opportunities that we see there.\nSecond, we do remain focused on optimizing investments within each product area.\nAnd then, third, as we talked about on prior calls, is investing to support operational excellence. And that includes things like driving efficiencies in our technical infrastructure, which I spoke about.\nWhen we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we -- as we've talked about already on this call -- continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see. It starts with Search, while also investing to build new businesses. And we've talked about a couple of them already today. Cloud is clearly an area where we're investing aggressively.\nIn Hardware, we've been investing heavily by developing our capabilities in hardware engineering, as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains.\nAnd then in YouTube, as I mentioned in opening comments, we do continue to build out our subscription services. It's still in the early days there, and we're making a sizable investment to build it out, taking a long-term view here.\nSo we are leaning into investing for long-term growth. That's been a core principle here and remains such, while looking at where can we optimize within portfolios and where can operational efficiencies be additive.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\n Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Sundar, I thought your 2020 focal points were really helpful, creating the most helpful products for everyone and then the most trusted experience for users. I was curious to kind of focus in those comments on payments and YouTube. You've had a lot of payment strategies over the last couple years. So talk about what types of investments or products you think you need to really remove friction and drive better payment adoption. And then on the YouTube side, if you sort of look at how people are using YouTube now from an engagement perspective, what types of changes do you foresee you need to make in order to really make it a more helpful product to drive engagement even higher on the YouTube platform? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: Brian, thanks.\nOn the payments side, clearly, I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences people see across our properties, including people do come with an intent to discover, learn and commercially engage as well. And when they're looking to transact, payments ends up playing a critical role. So the less friction you have, it tends to work better. So we have been really focused on doing that and getting more of our users set up in the right state.\nWe've had a lot of traction with our payments product over the past 18 months. We had a tremendously successful launch in India from which we learned a lot of features, and we're bringing that and we're revamping our payments products globally. And so I'm excited about that rollout, which is coming up in 2020. I think that will make the experience better.\nOn the YouTube side, I guess your question is about how are users engaging with the product. Overall, all our user metrics are very strong. They're global in nature. And increasingly we see newer verticals beginning to grow as well. So YouTube is working horizontally well at scale. And for us it's making sure as an ecosystem it works better so that the content there, the experiences there are improving.\nWe take our content responsibility work seriously, which makes more content creators engage and makes it a more valuable product for advertisers as well.\nBut also supplementing the content you see there with other types of accessorizing things, be it merchandising, ticket sales. When we make it contextually relevant, what we have done in Search and Search Ads over time, if we can bring that to YouTube and we see an opportunity, I think that sets us up well for the long-term there.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great, thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks. Ruth, in North America, was there anything that was abnormally unusual? Facebook had cited some weakness in North America. It looks like your\n\n North America number was relatively weak versus the last four years. Was there any anomaly that we should be aware of? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: Thanks for that.\nSo the regional breakdown also reflects product mix within regions. The U.S. year-on-year growth rate does reflect a decline in Hardware revenues relative to what was a fairly strong Hardware revenue growth rate in 4Q'18. And not much more to call out than that.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you. So, Sundar, I guess some of the more cross-product line synergies are showing up in an integrated software and hardware effort with stuff like the Pixel. But you've come up through the ranks at Google, so you are undoubtedly pretty sensitive to the various interests across various teams. But we're wondering what you may be looking to do to break down, I guess, what might have been more of a siloed effort in Google's history. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: You know, I think -- I spoke about execution at scale and so for us that means you have these product areas which are focused on their users. But we are setting up teams which cut across all these areas and make sure they can bring the synergies and work at scale.\nSo last year we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across. What is a shared infrastructure engineers can use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas? How can we commonly deploy AI across all these products? So I think that's been a good example of bringing teams together.\nAnother big area where we invested like that to break down silos is our partnerships. We set up a global partnerships team. And our ability to bring a common Google perspective to our big global partners, it's helped us strike many new partnerships. I mentioned Activision Blizzard just as an example. And they work and they are very synergistic with Cloud as well, to my point earlier. When people engage with us on Cloud, they're looking for -- they're interested in a bigger digital transformation across the board.\nGoogle Assistant is a great example of, because we are focused on the user, and the experience cuts across several of our product areas -- has been a great mechanism by which we can break down silos as well.\nBut it's a great question, and I spend a lot of time on it.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO\n\n Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I had two questions, one clarifying, one for Ruth, and then maybe a big-picture one for Sundar. Ruth, you distinguished between the growth of brand advertising and direct response on YouTube. Those comments were very clear. I just wanted to follow up and ask you how you make that distinction between brand and direct response. Is it a different pricing model? Is it the presence of an ad revenue share with a creator or both? I\u2019d just be curious on that distinction. And then to Sundar, the big-picture one, we have heard others in the ecosystem talk about headwinds from targeting growing. Certainly there are regulatory changes that also apply to you. You've made some changes to various Google advertising platforms; and, of course, you're an owner of two of the largest, most important platforms in Chrome and the Android operating system. I could ask you a billion things on that last one. But what I'd really like to ask is the big-picture question: If we roll up these sort of things for your total advertising business, how important are changes here to your top-line growth? Are you seeing notable headwinds from these types of changes in the ecosystem as well? Thanks.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: So on the first one, we have, again, this quarter talked about brand and direct response. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, brand is growing at a healthy pace and remains the largest component of YouTube Ads. Direct response is growing -- continues to grow at a very substantial growth.\nThe distinction here is the formats for -- in direct response, we're letting brands insert a tailored call to action in a video ad, such as signing up for a newsletter or scheduling an appointment or downloading an app or booking a trip, things of those sort. That's why it's the direct response category.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: And on the broader questions about headwinds, it's something we always need to take a look at. We try to stay focused on users and our partners, and we realize for these things to scale you need to make sure the ecosystem is working well.\nAnd so we are engaged in these issues, and we anticipate and structurally work on them early on. So it's how we broadly approach these things. And so there's nothing notable to call out, other than there will be continued changes in these ecosystems, and our ability to anticipate and adapt is key to the years ahead.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Great. Thank you. I'd like to ask a couple of bigger-picture things on the new disclosures. So, first, on YouTube monetization, assuming you have about 2 billion users, it's about $7 or $8 per user. Just wondering how you feel about that monetization level, given all the usage you're seeing there. And is there significant room to raise that when you compare it to other social networks? And then secondly on the cloud\n\n backlog, very strong number, $11.4, versus our IaaS/PaaS revenue rates. Just wondering about how strong the new deals have been that you've signed the last six months. Sounds like really good traction there. And then the profitability of these deals, how you feel about that. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: On the question around YouTube, I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. You're right, it's a platform working at scale.\nI think Ruth spoke a little bit about brand and direct response. I think direct response is a huge growth area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big opportunity for us.\nSo looking across, I think there is more room -- significantly more room over the mid- to long-term on monetization levels. And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it.\nOn Cloud, definitely, we are increasingly doing much larger deals. And these deals can sometimes span beyond Cloud as well, and they can touch many areas. So as an example, if you're an automotive company, we can be talking to you across Cloud, Android Auto, in some cases Waymo, and they all happen to be strong platform partners on the advertising side as well. So these are large deals, and we do want to build these in a sustainable way so that we can serve the partner well. And so profitability has been something we're very focused on as well.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: And just to add a little more to that, the $11.4 billion backlog number is -- for us we view it as a way to quantify the traction that we're having. And as you know well, in the Enterprise space, these tend to grow over time and profitability as such comes across the cohorts.\nHowever, the point that we were trying to make and have made a couple of times here on the call is that we are investing aggressively in Cloud overall, given the opportunity that we see and the momentum we're having, and we'll continue to do so.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Youssef Squali from\nSuntrust. Your line is now open.\nYoussef Squali (SunTrust): Okay. Great. Thank you. Two quick ones. First, Ruth, has the shortened holiday season had much of an impact on your Search business in North America? And then, Sundar, as you talk about automation machine learning, AI, how much of advertisers' Search spend is now on auto bidding? And how do you think Smart Bidding is affecting spending growth and pricing? Thank you.\n\n Ruth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: So on the holiday shopping season, there's really nothing to highlight there. What we find is there are seasonal puts and takes in any given period. So really nothing to note.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: I don't have specific numbers to add here. But effectively we do see significant traction in these areas, and advertisers are leveraging the features we have -- we are bringing it here, be it Smart Bidding, auto bidding. There's tremendous traction with our advertisers here.\nYoussef Squali (SunTrust): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from\nEvercore. Your line is now open.\nKevin Rippey (Evercore ISI): Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is primarily for Sundar. As you think about the risk profile of some of your businesses like Waymo, like Verily in healthcare. How do you manage those risks which likely -- in a scenario where autonomous cars have some accident or something like that, having those in-house and the perhaps brand damage that could do to Google versus what you could do if those were entirely separate enterprises? I know they are all held under the Alphabet umbrella, but just sort of big picture, how you think about managing that risk over time? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Kevin.\nWe are -- as I spoke earlier in the remarks, part of the reason we are making sure we are investing in the proper governance structures, so that we don't try to scale as a management across these important areas. Some of these are -- have regulatory aspects to it.\nWe are -- for some of these Bets as well -- and Verily is a great example -- we've brought in outside investors -- people with expertise, and setting up proper board structures and governance for these.\nSo I think those all help, and we'll continue to evaluate these on a periodic basis and bring that rigor and discipline.\nBut I do think Alphabet gives us a more flexible framework, if you will, to both have the independence when we need, but where we can have a common, shared synergies like our AI investments, bring that to bear as well.\nKevin Rippey (Evercore ISI): Thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open.\n\n Benjamin Wheeler (RBC): Hi. This is Ben on for Mark. Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, I just kind of want to double click on something you said before, in terms of Other Bets, kind of like a sharpening focus on the asset -- the allocation there. Was that kind of -- is that kind of signaling more of the same, or is that kind of potentially maybe prioritizing investments more towards, like, share buybacks and stuff like that as opposed to -- like basically I'm trying to ask: Should we expect greater rationalization in the Other Bets segment going forward, or is it more of the same? Thanks a lot.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: So what I was saying is that when we look at the Other Bets and execution, we've talked over time about measuring them against specific metrics and milestones, operating business, technology, financial performance, and we -- and we look at that as we calibrate the pace of investment, the approach to investments. And we're continuing to do that.\nWe're putting a sharper focus on, as Sundar indicated, looking at -- where does it make sense to work with external capital as we did with Verily as an example.\nBut the bigger point is, we continue to invest for the long-term. And when we look at our capital return approach, it's very consistent with what we've talked about previously. The primary use of capital continues to be to support long-term growth in Google and in Other Bets, and then it's about strategic investments and on top of that return of capital to shareholders.\nBenjamin Wheeler (RBC): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from\nBarclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Hi. Yeah, two questions. The Google segment margin looked really strong in the fourth quarter. I think this is the first time that mix shift actually helped you guys from a margin perspective. So, Ruth, can you just talk about how much of that margin increase year-on-year was from the Hardware business dropping off versus improving elsewhere? And then as you move forward, you mentioned that headcount is going to accelerate in 2020. So is this an investment year, in your view, or just kind of more of the steady kind of increase? And then the second question, on YouTube, a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there. What percent of AdWords advertisers are buying Search-only versus buying Search and YouTube at this stage? And it looks like from your new disclosure that YouTube decelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. Any color on what's driving that relative to the full year '19 growth rate? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google: Okay. So taking the first part of that, in terms of the operating margin in the fourth quarter, there were a number of discrete items in the fourth quarter last year 2018. So that did result in a favorable Google op inc year-on-year comparison for this year. And as you said, the other cost of sales does reflect lower expenses related to Hardware in Q4 in particular versus last year.\n\n But I think the main point to leave you with is that we do intend to continue to invest aggressively to support growth in the areas that we have already talked about quite a bit on this call, in Search and Cloud and Hardware and in YouTube.\nIn terms of headcount, I tried to break it out in my closing comments that it starts with those areas, putting headcount behind the areas where we're investing for the long-term. And then we have a couple of additional factors that are somewhat expected to boost the year-on-year growth rate. One is bringing some support in-house that's opex neutral. And the other is the Fitbit acquisition.\nIn terms of the third part of your question, I'm just trying to recall it, the -- in terms of the mix, I'm not sure there's much to add there.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you. I guess first, just given the focus and new leadership team in Commerce, was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunity you see for innovation there at the transactional part of the funnel. And then as a quick follow-up, on the acceleration in GCP, beyond the size of the deals, were there particular product areas like BigQuery or something else worth calling out that might have inflected to drive that acceleration? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google: Great. On Commerce, I'm really excited Bill Ready is here. He brings a lot of experience. And you mentioned the transactional part of the funnel, and I think it's an area where he brings a lot of experience, given his prior work.\nBut we definitely see opportunity to improve in the overall user experience, in terms of how we present our results, the visual nature of it, making that experience more delightful. And then people are interested in something, how do you make it more seamless to complete the transaction and bringing in deep partnerships with merchants and retailers to making that happen. So excited about the opportunity there. And that's where we are investing.\nOn GCP, we did see -- it's been a lot to do with bringing to bear all the resources we have and engaging while on these deals. And the execution there has been great. And it's definitely -- we see strong traction in data analytics. And so our strength there as a company is definitely contributing significantly, as well as our overall leadership in AI.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for\ntoday. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any further remarks.\nEllen West, VP Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward\n\n to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2020 conference call. Thank you and have a good evening.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.", "20201": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q1 2020 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q1 2020 Earnings Call April 28, 2020\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Alphabet first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you will need to press star one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s first-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I\u2019ll quickly go over the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, expected to be filed with the SEC later today. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. When I last spoke with you in early February, no one could have imagined how much the world would change, and how suddenly. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19, especially those who\u2019ve lost loved ones or their livelihoods. It\u2019s a challenging moment for the world. Through it all, we\u2019re incredibly grateful for all of the essential workers on the front-lines of this crisis, from health care workers and first-responders, to the grocery store clerks and delivery workers, to teachers grappling with new technology to help children learn remotely, to all of the scientists and researchers working hard to develop vaccines and treatments, and many others who are leading through these difficult times. Thank you. These people fill us with hope and show us the power of human resilience. We\u2019ll need that energy and resolve in the months and years ahead.\nToday, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path to recovery. But there are some things that we can understand better with the patterns we are seeing. For example, it\u2019s clear from data that people are being more cautious and are seeking authoritative advice and guidance to protect their families\u2019 health and safety. A return to normal economic activity depends on how effectively societies manage the spread of the virus. There\u2019s no one size fits all and the timing and pace of recovery will vary from location to location. This is a long-term effort.\nIt\u2019s also clear that this is the first major pandemic taking place in a digital world. Many parts of the economy are also able to continue with some semblance of normalcy, thanks to advances in\n\n remote work, online shopping, delivery options, home entertainment and telemedicine. At the same time, newer technologies like AI, Bluetooth exposure notifications and 3D printing are being used to help fight the disease head on.\nIt\u2019s now clear that once the emergency has passed, the world will not look the same. Some social norms will change, and many businesses are speaking to us, looking to reinvent their operations. We have seen that the most pressing concern of small and large businesses right now is business continuity, solving for issues like employee safety, dramatic falls or surges in demand, supply chains and managing a remote workforce.\nUltimately, we\u2019ll see a long term acceleration of movement from businesses to digital services, including increased online work, education, medicine, shopping and entertainment. These changes will be significant, and lasting. Given the depth of challenges so many are facing, it\u2019s been a huge privilege to be able to help people and businesses at this moment.\nIn today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll cover four areas. First, I\u2019ll mention some of the ways we have marshalled our resources and product development to help. Second, I\u2019ll talk about how people are using our products at this unprecedented moment. Third, I\u2019ll talk about our business, especially our advertising business which was significantly impacted in the last few weeks of the quarter. And I\u2019ll close with our investment plans and focus for the rest of the year.\nIn the early days of the crisis, we were able to put in motion a number of efforts quickly. This is a testament to strategic areas where we have invested over recent years: products that people trust, our technical leadership and innovation, deep partnerships, a highly skilled workforce, and the scale and resilience of our operations.\nI\u2019ve been proud of all of these efforts and what they say about our company. I\u2019ll give just a few examples. First, we\u2019ve been working with healthcare providers, researchers, authorities and communities to help combat the virus. Our community mobility reports help authorities see, in aggregate, how social distancing requirements are working. Verily has tested thousands of people in California and has partnered with Rite Aid to bring free testing to eight additional states. Google Cloud is forming deep partnerships, such as with leading health care provider HCA Healthcare, to understand data around ICU bed availability, ventilator supplies and test results. And you may have read about our exposure notification partnership with Apple, designed specifically and carefully to protect users\u2019 privacy while helping public health authorities and governments manage countries\u2019 re-opening.\nSecond, we are working hard to provide accurate and authoritative information to people using our services. In Search, we've launched a number of features such as up-to-date answers from health authorities, and remote medical care options. On YouTube, we are quickly removing content that violates policy, and raising authoritative content from news organizations and experts. Up to last week, our COVID-19 info panels have had 20 billion impressions.\nThird, we\u2019re playing a role in supporting businesses and workers that are hurting because of the downturn. In March, we made a commitment upwards of $800 million to support small businesses and crisis response efforts, through a combination of grants, small business loans and ad credits. And the Google News Initiative is offering financial support to thousands of small, medium and local news publishers through a Journalism Emergency Relief Fund. We\u2019ve\n\n also waived ad serving fees for news publishers globally on Ad Manager for the next five months.\nTurning to the way people are using our products. People are relying on Google\u2019s services more than ever. This is a strong recognition of the value of our products, particularly in important and urgent moments. As a few examples, we\u2019ve seen a significant rise in search activity. To put it into perspective, in the U.S., coronavirus-related search activity at its peak was four times greater than during the peak of the Super Bowl. People are spending significantly more time on their Android apps, with downloads of apps from Google Play rising 30% from February to March. YouTube watchtime has also significantly increased. One area in particular is livestreams. I hope you saw Andrea Bocelli on YouTube Live on Easter, which has had over 39 million views. It was truly beautiful. One hundred million students and educators are using Google Classroom, double the number from the beginning of March. We've seen a massive increase in demand for Chromebooks; analysts have reported a 400% increase during the week of March 21st year-over-year. And schools and businesses in particular are using our secure video conferencing platform Meet. Last week, we surpassed a significant milestone and are now adding roughly 3 million new users each day, and have seen a thirty fold increase in usage since January. There are now over 100 million daily Meet meeting participants. Stay tuned for much more!\nTurning to our business, let me touch on our performance this quarter. Q1 was in many ways the tale of two quarters. For our advertising business, the first two months of the quarter were strong. In March, we experienced a significant and sudden slowdown in ad revenues. The timing of the slowdown correlated to the locations and sectors impacted by the virus and related shutdown orders. As the impact of COVID-19 came into view, we delayed some ad launches and prioritized supporting our customers as many adjusted their strategies. We're focused on products where we can help most advertisers and merchants during the crisis. For example, under our new leader of Commerce, Bill Ready, last week we announced that merchants can list products in Google Shopping for free. It\u2019s been widely rolled out in the U.S., with more countries to come, and the response has been positive. Overall, recovery in ad spend will depend on a return to economic activity.\nThere are two key aspects of our business that give us confidence about the future. First, as we saw after 2008, one of the strongest features of Search is that it can be adjusted quickly, so it\u2019s relatively easier to turn off and then back on, and marketers see it as highly cost-effective and ROI based.\nSecond, our business is more diversified than it was in 2008. For example, Cloud. In the public sector, we are helping governments deliver critical health and social services. We\u2019re supporting the State of New York\u2019s new online unemployment application system as it deals with a significant increase in demand. In retail, we\u2019ve helped Loblaw, one of Canada\u2019s largest food retailers, and Wayfair scale to support exponential traffic increases. We are helping communication companies adapt to new behavior patterns. Vodafone is using Google Cloud Platform to help it analyze network traffic flows to keep everyone connected and we are helping Unity Technologies keep real-time online games stay up and running. Institutions like Lloyds Bank are digitally transforming their businesses and we are helping even more businesses do the same through new partnerships with Accenture, AT&T, and T-Systems. We now have more than six million paying G Suite customers. G Suite is helping Netflix and German manufacturer,\n\n Kaeser Compressors transition quickly to remote work, while Twitter, Shopify, retailer Schnucks and Italian bank Credem are using Meet for things like all hands and customer meetings.\nElsewhere across the business, YouTube subscriptions continue to grow. The team has launched YouTube Kids in 15 new countries around the world since the beginning of the year, and rolled out new features to make kids-focused channels safer. Android previewed Android 11, which includes seamless 5G connectivity and a smarter keyboard with a faster messaging experience. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve seen significant growth in Play. There are now over 2.5 billion monthly active Play devices worldwide. And in Hardware, we saw a decline in device activations in the quarter, due to falling consumer demand globally. But I am excited about the product roadmap ahead for the year - including yesterday\u2019s launch of Pixel Buds 2.\nFinally, moving on to our focus for the rest of the year. We\u2019re taking a long view and continuing to invest in our long term priorities, but are being thoughtful in the short term. So we made the decision to slow down the pace of hiring for the remainder of 2020, while maintaining momentum in a small number of strategic areas. We\u2019re also recalibrating the focus and pace of our investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel. We\u2019ll also continue to thoughtfully manage our Other Bets portfolio. Waymo raised $2.25 billion in its first external investment round, a terrific validation of their technology and long-term business model. Wing saw a surge in deliveries and new users, increasing its daily volume fivefold, with great momentum in test programs in Australia and Virginia.\nAt Google, we\u2019ll continue to be focused on the four key areas that I outlined in the last earnings call. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone, particularly at a time where people rely on us for information, work, education and entertainment.\nSecond, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. This includes our efforts to tackle misinformation and digital threats, as well as our work to safeguard consumer privacy.\nThird, executing at scale. I\u2019ve been proud of how we continue to work so cohesively and productively, even with a distributed workforce. We will continue to build on the internal tools, support systems and infrastructure we have built over the years.\nAnd finally, creating sustainable value. We\u2019ll be optimizing the way our data centers work, and prioritizing strategic areas of investment where we need to support our users and partners.\nLet me express my thanks to our employees for their herculean efforts under these difficult circumstances. While the road ahead for everyone is uncertain, we\u2019ll continue to support our users, communities and partners, and we\u2019ll all emerge, together, from this moment. Thank you, and please take care, everyone. Over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Sundar. Our results for the first quarter are a \u201ctale of two quarters,\u201d with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February, followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues as governments globally instituted stay-at-home orders in response to COVID-19. At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance, particularly Google Cloud. I\u2019ll provide more details on the impact of the crisis as I review the Google segment revenue results and conclude with an update to the outlook that I shared on our fourth\n\n quarter call. Sundar and I will then take your questions.\nStarting with consolidated Alphabet results, in the first quarter our Total Revenues were $41.2 billion, up 13% year-on-year, and up 15% in constant currency, driven by Search, YouTube and Cloud. Details of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. In short, advertising results reflect, in large part, the nature and timing of actions around the globe in response to COVID-19. The decline in APAC was more muted than what we have seen in the rest of the world given the uneven impact of COVID, as well as the composition of our revenues, in the region. The impact in the rest of the world began later and was more acute by the end of the quarter. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in a modest headwind to reported revenues.\nRegarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $19.0 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here, again this quarter, were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; and then content acquisition costs - primarily for YouTube\u2019s advertising-supported content, followed by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services. Operating expenses were $14.2 billion, with headcount growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for R&D and sales and marketing expenses. For G&A, the biggest driver of expense growth was attributable to a reserve for estimated credit deterioration as a result of COVID-19. Stock-based compensation totaled $3.2 billion. Headcount was up 4,149 from the fourth quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud, for both technical and sales roles.\nOperating income was $8.0 billion, down 4% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the EC fine in the first quarter of last year, for an operating margin of 19%. Other Income & Expense, was a loss of $220 million, driven primarily by losses in equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 11.9%. Net income was $6.8 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.87.\nTurning now to Capex and operating cash flow. Cash Capex for the quarter was $6.0 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating Cash Flow was $11.5 billion with Free Cash Flow of $5.4 billion. We repurchased $8.5 billion of our shares. We ended the quarter with Cash & Marketable Securities of approximately $117 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment. Revenues were $41.0 billion, up 14% year-over-year. I\u2019ll now go through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenues: we generated $24.5 billion in revenues in the quarter, that was up 9% year-over-year. This reflects strong year-on-year growth for the first two months of the quarter. In March, revenues began to decline and ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. Although users\u2019 search activity increased, their interests shifted to less commercial topics. In addition, there was also reduced spending by our advertisers.\nYouTube advertising revenues were $4.0 billion, up 33% year-on-year. Significant YouTube revenue growth persisted until late in the first quarter, with different performance trajectories for\n\n the brand and direct response components. Direct response continued to have substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire quarter. Brand advertising growth accelerated in the first two months of the quarter, but began to experience a headwind in mid-March. As a result, by the end of March, total YouTube Ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits.\nNetwork advertising revenues were $5.2 billion, up 4% year-on-year, with healthy year-on-year growth for the first two months of the quarter. We ended March at a year-on-year percentage decline in Network revenues in the low double digits.\nTurning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite, revenues were $2.8 billion for the first quarter, up 52% year-over-year, driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth at G Suite. Once again, the growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall. GCP growth was led by our Infrastructure offerings and our Data and Analytics platform. We\u2019re pleased with the ongoing growth in G Suite, which continues to reflect growth in both seat count and average revenue per seat. With respect to the implications of the global crisis for Google Cloud, we\u2019re proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors, including public sector and healthcare for disease monitoring and control, working with leading retailers on demand forecasting, working with companies across media and communications to enhance their customer service, and across industries on supply chain optimization.\nIn the first quarter, Other Revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and Play. YouTube\u2019s contribution to Other Revenues benefited from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues continued to benefit from strong growth in the number of active buyers in the first quarter. In addition, in the latter part of the quarter, we started to see an increase in user engagement in apps, as well as in digital content.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $7.5 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 9% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting once again a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Google Properties. Google Operating Income was $9.3 billion, up 1% versus last year, and the operating margin was 23%. Google Accrued Capex for the quarter was $5.7 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, followed by servers and office facilities.\nMoving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the first quarter, revenues were $135 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating Loss was $1.1 billion for the first quarter.\nLet me now conclude with our thoughts on the impact of the global crisis on our revenues and investments, including an update on the outlook I shared on our fourth quarter earnings call. We remain optimistic about the underlying strength of our business over the long term. On a daily basis our products play an important role for consumers and businesses globally. This has been evident throughout the crisis in the usage metrics that Sundar referenced earlier. We\u2019re humbled that users continue to turn to us as much as they do in a time of global need and uncertainty. We take that responsibility very seriously. Users clearly are depending on us to provide useful and accurate information; they are looking to YouTube for information, education and entertainment constantly as they study, create and work from home; they are using our G Suite products to collaboratively communicate, connect and work.\n\n Although users may not be focused as much on purely commercial activities right now, over the long-term, the value we provide to billions of users globally serves us well. Our previous investments in technical infrastructure ensure that we have the capacity and resilience to meet the increased demand from our users in this extraordinary time. We are re-doubling our efforts to help our advertising customers and partners by sharing insights and developing new tools to keep them connected to their customers and help them be best positioned for recovery.\nIn terms of more specific product points, I will start with Search advertising where our financial results are driven in part by users\u2019 search behavior. At the inception of the crisis, the increase in user interest was for information about COVID-19 and related, non-commercial topics. Although we have seen some very early signs of recovery in commercial search behavior by users, it is not clear how durable or monetizable this behavior will be. In order to gauge the ongoing potential financial impact to our business from COVID-19, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with advertising spend. As of today, we anticipate that the second quarter will be a difficult one for our advertising business. As we move beyond the crisis and the global economy normalizes, this should be reflected in our advertising revenues, but it would be premature to comment on timing given all the variables here.\nIn terms of Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the team, reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP industry specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses operate efficiently and effectively.\nMoving on to profitability. While TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of items in Other Cost of Revenues that are generally less variable in nature such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure, as well as for activities like customer support and content review. Much of our operating expense is also not directly correlated to changes in revenues. Given that we are faced with a global crisis of uncertain depth and duration, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency, including slowing the pace of hiring and some categories of marketing spend as well as further enhancing machine utilization.\nMore specifically, with respect to the pace of hiring, last quarter I indicated that the rate of headcount growth in 2020 would be slightly higher than the 20% growth in 2019. We now anticipate a deceleration in headcount growth that should start to be visible in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. Although we are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall pace of investment, we remain committed to the long term opportunities for which we are well positioned, so we will continue to invest in these areas, including Search, Machine Learning and Google Cloud.\nFinally, with respect to capex, on the fourth quarter call we shared our expectation that investments in both Technical Infrastructure and office facilities would increase compared to 2019. We now anticipate a modest decrease in the level of total capex in 2020 compared with last year. The biggest change in our outlook is a reduction in global office facility investments due to both the need to pause most of our ground-up construction and fit-outs in response to COVID-19, and our decision to slow down the pace at which we acquire office buildings.\n\n In terms of Technical Infrastructure, we expect a moderate reduction to our forecast relative to the beginning of the year given the impact of COVID-19 on data center construction delays as well as the benefit of our ongoing focus on server efficiency. Overall, we anticipate Technical Infrastructure investment to remain at roughly the same level as in 2019, with relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction. Thank you and Sundar and I will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks for taking the question and hope all is safe and well with everyone on the team there, at Alphabet. Two questions, if I can. One, on the comment with respect to direct response advertising on YouTube, we wanted to get a little more color on how direct response advertising as ad units continued to evolve and perform and how advertisers are using those ad units as part of their broader advertising goals. And then, maybe, Ruth, for you, on the comment on expenses, just want to understand a little bit of how much of what you're messaging on expenses is efficiency gains that you were aiming for in 2020 before we got to COVID-19 versus elements of the cost structure that you're reexamining as a result of the pandemic. Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Eric, thanks. Thanks for the wishes. On YouTube direct response, we definitely have seen traction there. I think an area where it really works well, for example, is app installs. That's a great example of it. Gaming is another good example of it. And we are working on iterating and making the formats work better so that it applies to more contexts as well.\nBut, in general, I think businesses are learning to adapt. Obviously, we've had great success with Search. And so we're bringing a lot of those learnings and we're sharing it with our customers. And so we expect to see more traction there over time.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And on your second question, I like the way you framed it. Yes, we do have efficiency efforts that we started that we had going as we entered this year. But as a result of what we're seeing in the environment, our view was that we should really double down on those.\nAnd so when we go through the various areas that I mentioned, we had started the year with an expectation about really optimizing headcount around the various areas. What we've determined is we're going to at this point slow the pace of hiring. To be very clear, we are continuing to hire, but we are slowing the pace of hiring. And that's helping as we're driving a deeper look into how do you optimize within each area.\nThe same is true, for example, in some of the comments on marketing. We are continuing to invest in marketing. As you know well, sales and marketing line, the majority of it is headcount-related. And we do continue to invest here in Ads and, in particular, in Cloud. As it relates to the marketing component, namely, Ads and Promo spend, we did reduce it relative to our plans in the beginning of the year. And we continue to have a healthy budget for Ads and\n\n Promo, particularly in digital, to support many business areas. But as with the other areas of investment, we're really focused on optimizing across products and services. And with physical events cancelled for much of the year, marketing spend is also reduced. And so that's another example.\nWith machines and servers, we've been focused on efficiency of the fleet for some time now. This is giving us the opportunity to push that even further.\nSo we're looking at the operating environment and saying we should continue to lean into the efficiency programs we can. It does help us free up some resources for the growth areas that continue to be a priority. But it is an accentuation of where we were.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thanks so much.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar. One for Ruth. First, Sundar, you just talked about how once the crisis has passed, the world will not look the same. I'm curious if you can just elaborate a little bit more on how you think Alphabet comes out stronger on the other side of this downturn. And then, Ruth, maybe taking the question on expenses a little bit further. Does this give you any more opportunity to be even more disciplined or diligent on costs on the other side as well? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Doug. It's a good question. And we are thinking deeply about it as well. In general, I would say the highest-level opportunities across everywhere, we see businesses thinking deeper about the shift to digital. And that's true across marketing, Cloud, on every place we see that trend. And so part of this is making sure our investments deliver value with respect to that shift.\nSo if you look at Advertising, people who in the past may have debated things like how do I get virtual showrooming now are really thinking about it. People who may have been hesitant to shift their budgets are looking through moments like this and trying to get all that working better.\nCloud is an obvious area. Every company has been thinking about digital transformation, but they are asking the questions deeper. For example, if you have data centers, there are fixed costs for something like this. And you learn going through moments like that and you're thinking about the opportunity harder.\nSo across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long-term opportunity. And I would say overall on Alphabet as well, when you look at investments like Waymo and Wing, you can imagine in the future, these things working well can play a significant role. And even in the limited areas Wing is in, we clearly saw its potential through a moment like this. So we are betting on those big trends.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And to your other question, if I understood it correctly, you're asking about the durability of some of the efficiency efforts.\n\n Doug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Yes.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: I think that the way I would answer that is, after a decade of growth, there have to be opportunities for added efficiency. And we've been focused on that for some time. But painful times like this put a spotlight on an urgency around making sure you're focused on the levers that you have. And hopefully, those instill the right kinds of health metrics, et cetera, against which you're managing. So I would say that the intent most certainly is that these are durable investments to ensure that we're operating as effectively and as efficiently as we can be.\nAnd I just need to reiterate -- and Sundar and I both said this -- we remain committed to investing for the long-term. So we're not compromising where we need to invest for long-term growth. We're trying to make sure that each dollar of investment is well managed.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Ruth, I had two questions for you, actually. First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth you're seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the Ads business. And, there's been some signs from different partners or different companies that ad spending, while still down considerably, has actually improved a little bit, maybe some green shoots from the declines that you might have been referencing at the end of March. Any chance you can give us a sense of the type of growth you've been seeing for the first, kind of three, four weeks of the quarter, just to kind of help level-set us. And then just in regards to the provision you mentioned in G&A related to credit deterioration, is there a chance you can tell us the amount of that provision? And do you expect to have to do this again in the second quarter? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you for those. So in terms of Ads revenue, as I said in opening comments, for our Ads business, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend. And I think it's premature for me to comment on the trend.\nIn terms of what we saw in the first quarter, as we said, for Search and Other Revenues, they were up 9% year-on-year for the quarter. But in March, revenues began to decline and then ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues.\nAnd then with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged. And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial -- had substantial growth throughout the quarter, while Brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March. So by the end of March, total YouTube Ads Revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high single-digits.\nAnd then, for the second quarter, so far -- I think it's premature to gauge, given uncertainty in the environment. And a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter. So in such an unprecedented\n\n crisis, I would not want you to extrapolate from just a couple of weeks.\nThat being said, the decline in our Search and Other Ads Revenue was abrupt in March. And although we're seeing some early signs at this point that users are returning to more commercial behavior, it's not clear how durable or monetizable that will be.\nSo based on our estimates from the end of March through last week, for Search, we haven't seen further deterioration in the percentage of year-on-year revenue declines. For YouTube, direct response has remained strong. However, we have seen a continued decline in Brand advertising. And it's really too early to add more.\nI think the main point, though, is, a few weeks obviously is not a quarter. And given it is such an unprecedented environment, I would not extrapolate from these comments for the full quarter.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Sorry. No, that was very helpful. So thank you, on behalf of everybody. And then just the G&A that you mentioned, the credit provisions that you said you took, I just was wondering if you could share the amount. It might be in the Q later tonight, but just wondering if you could share with us the amount on the call.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: It will be in the Q later tonight. Heather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Okay. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, people have asked you about your priorities. You've talked about it. But I wonder if you could step back and think about what this crisis will do to the other side. And maybe a reorienting of your priorities? So perhaps where you would shift spend in the long term to maybe take advantage of where this is going? And then, Ruth, we appreciate the color on YouTube. Just want to dig in some more. If you can give us any sense of YouTube geographies. Is there any difference by change by geography? That would be really helpful, too. So thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: In terms of overall priorities, I would say we've always taken a long-term view in thinking through the arc of where things are going. And our deep focus on AI is an example of that. And we've been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term. And so, if anything, through moments like that, the strong foundation we've built, allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term areas. So AI is a good example of it.\nThe shift over time on computing to ambient computing is something we're going to be deeply committed to and continue to invest there. Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment.\nAnd so the thesis still remains. So we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we 11\n\n are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, deep computational scale -- is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like that.\nBeyond that, we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging. So, for example, eCommerce is an area. And you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our Shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there. And with new leaders in place, we're going to be making sure we work on the user experience there.\nAnd so we are looking at shifts, be it video conferencing with Google Meet and G Suite, and adapting and investing in those areas as well. So that's how we're approaching it.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of the geographic breakdown for YouTube, we -- I haven't broken that down, although I think, as you know well, we have a breakdown for the major regions around the world. And to give you a little more color there, in mid-February, revenue growth across the business began to decelerate in APAC. Although, as I noted, the decline in APAC was more muted, just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our business across the region.\nAnd then the impact in EMEA was first evident in mid-February, with a steeper falloff in March. And in the second week of March, we then saw results in the U.S. as well as Other Americas fall off shortly. But nothing more specific by product.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thank you, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from\nMorgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Ruth, just to go back to your comments around the early signs of improvements in behavior in Search. I know it's early and don't want to over-extrapolate, but just any more detail on the types of behavior you're seeing of which verticals or which categories or which geographies where you\u2019re seeing sort of the first sign of green shoots on the Search side? And then, Sundar, just to go back to your comments about the shift toward digital opportunities or digital transformation, maybe talk to us about as you sort of look back over the last couple years at what you've done on the SMB side and what are sort of one or two of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post-recovery?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Maybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on the Ad side, too. On the SMB side, it's an area we've been investing in for a while. And, obviously, we have assets both across AdWords, Google Maps, Google My Business, and obviously providing them with G Suite and the tools to get their business running. So I do think we have a lot of touchpoints.\nBut the focus has been simplifying it, making it more of a -- one cohesive, easy experience, making sure it works well for mobile, that there is a truly lighter-weight AdWords experience so that they can get onboarded quicker and so reducing the work they need to and also over time bringing technologies like AI to just make it all much simpler and seamless for them.\n\n And it's going to be a continued focus for us, and especially scaling this up and making sure it works internationally well, as well. We have clear metrics and targets internally, and we are aligning the teams better to get there. And you will see us do more.\nOn the Ads side, to your question about -- maybe I can give more qualitative color to what Ruth said earlier. The good thing about Search Ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but Search primarily, is that it's an extraordinarily effective system. It's a transparent system. You have a very clear sense of ROI. It's very measurable, highly cost effective.\nAnd so we have always seen -- and we saw this in 2008 as well -- people respond in the short term, but the recovery is also fast when it comes back. And so it tends to work.\nIt is very diversified, not just geographically, by different verticals. And even through moments like that, we do see businesses responding to demand shift. And, so we see through our system if people suddenly are looking for office furniture or even pajamas -- the system responds, right? And so you see the dynamic nature of it.\nI mentioned earlier people are really thinking about the shift to digital. So Philipp and our Ads team are super engaged with our customers, helping them think through the opportunities through moments like that. I gave an earlier example. If you're thinking about cars and you have been hesitant to do virtual car showrooming, now is the time you are beginning to have those conversations in a deeper way.\nThere are budgets which are shifting in certain cases. Some of the large customers, maybe they've spent a lot of money on live sports. That is clearly on hold. So they are looking to shift some of those budgets into opportunities they see.\nBut having said that, there are large sectors of the economy which are affected. Things like Travel and our large partners and customers are impacted. And so we clearly see the impact of that, and that's the color Ruth gave as well.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Good afternoon. I'm curious if you could just give us a little more color across SMB and enterprise, any common threads you saw between those two segments?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Maybe -- We have had tremendous momentum on G Suite -- and all of Google works this way. Products like Gmail, Google Docs were built from the ground up to really help people be productive and collaborative in a distributed work environment. And so we are clearly seeing traction there.\nGoogle Meet is seeing great traction. And I gave -- I mentioned some user momentum there. But we have more announcements coming up, including later this week. And so we are seeing tremendous traction and engagement on G Suite.\n\n On Cloud, the shift to digital has been a deep trend. And, if anything, people are really engaged on it. I earlier talked about, you can imagine if you're a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed costs when you go through moments like this. And so people are really looking at opportunities there, and so our teams are super engaged.\nBut I do want to acknowledge, small businesses across the world are deeply impacted. As a company, we have announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses, and we are going to be deeply engaged with them. But I think it's a tough journey we are all on. And we look forward to working with them to help them through this.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO Capital Markets): Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I wanted to return to those long-term initiatives that you walked through earlier and the one that was most close to your core business and the changes that were announced this week for Shopping. Could you explain a little bit more about the reasons for making those changes and expanding the free listings or creating the free listings, and what drove you to make that decision now? And then a related follow-up for Ruth. Same question, essentially, but as we think about the financial impact of such a change, I imagine this is one of those things which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the quarter-to-quarter rate but something that benefits all parties over the long-term, I think, is how we've often visited these sorts of changes. But any color you could add on sort of the near and the long-term impact of the Google Shopping changes would be great, too.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: So going through a moment like this, it's very clear. Part of what makes Google work well is people come across a diverse range of needs. And that's true for Shopping. They spend time discovering. And comprehensiveness really matters. That's how we can have a great user experience.\nAnd so as we've been thinking about this space, we realize -- and this is how organic Search works -- for us to truly give that comprehensiveness and the quality of experience, we need the widest catalog possible. And then we are good at ranking it and matching users to what they are looking for.\nAnd so it is -- it made a lot of sense for us and just looking through the range of experiences people were seeking through the COVID pandemic validated it even more. And then, obviously, we've been executing really hard there with new leadership in place. And so we saw the opportunity to go back to our first principles and improve the comprehensiveness there.\nOne of the tricky things about when you do that is making sure you don't have spam and you're managing and giving people good-quality experiences. And that's where our deeper partnership, be it with PayPal and other providers, so that we get the quality signals and really improve the experience as we improve comprehensiveness. So both of them are going hand in hand. And as we've demonstrated with Search, when we improve the organic experience, the advertising experience also gives an opportunity and the system works well.\n\n And so I'm really excited about this change. It is still early, but it's been very positively received. And you're going to see us enhance the experience in this area deeply.\nWhile we talk about Shopping, another area where we are investing and building the right foundation is with Google Pay. And we have great leadership there as well. We've been executing well over there for the past year, and the growth on Google Pay has been strong. And so being able to bring all of that together, along with strong players like PayPal, et cetera, will help us give great experiences for our users here.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of your question about the financial implications of the effort, there's really not much to add here today. I would just say -- re-echo Sundar's comment. We're excited to have Bill leading the effort. And as Sundar said at the outset, one of the priorities is creating sustainable financial value. And we have a leader who has a demonstrated track record of doing that, so we're excited about what he is building here with the team.\nDan Salmon (BMO Capital Markets): Okay. Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of\nAmerica. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Great. Appreciated all the advertising updates in March. Just wondering, your Cloud growth was obviously quite stable, in the low 50\u2019s. Any impact in March on workloads or slowdown in the new customer pipeline? And then maybe, Sundar, if you can talk about what could be the benefit for Cloud as we get to the other side of this? More work from home or just other things and secular changes in Cloud that might come about from this? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Overall, in Cloud, the interest and the momentum remains strong. We are obviously making a lot of progress both across GCP and G Suite. And we find our offerings are getting deeper, and we are really helping customers from a deeper standpoint.\nSo we see overall momentum. There are cases where even though the deal trajectory is the same and we have the wins, things are taking a bit longer. Naturally, as you would expect, our customers are impacted through moments like this, too. So I would say time to closing some larger deals are impacted. But the companies, if anything, all the way at a CEO level are thinking about the shift to digital in a deeper way. And I think that's a longer-term trend we are excited about.\nObviously, consumption gets impacted, depending on the sectors which companies are in. And so that has some correlation with the general underlying performance of that sector. And so that's something we'll have to wait and see how it develops.\nBut the teams are doing well, and it's an area where we are committed to the course we are on and investing deeply for the long run.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And you asked about Q2. Nothing to highlight there. 15\n\n I\u2019d just reiterate what Sundar said. We're really pleased with the Q1 performance for both GCP and G Suite. And the dynamics affecting Cloud are obviously very different than those from Ads. And just to build on Sundar's comments with a little more on G Suite and some of our opening comments, in this work-from-home environment, what we're seeing is significant interest from governments and companies looking for work-from-home solutions. So just to add one more example, Cambridge Health Alliance is a U.S. health system with 140,000 patients. And they relied on G Suite to support their staff and caregivers during COVID-19, helping them connect across hospitals, health centers, from home. And it's just yet another example of how we're able to be present, helpful, useful in this time.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from\nEvercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nKevin Rippey (Evercore ISI): Hi. Thanks for taking the question, guys. One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, the question for you really relates to the resiliency you're seeing at the direct response piece of YouTube. Are there specific factors or is it a question of mix of advertisers there that's sustaining the growth? And then the question for Ruth, you highlighted that this has given you an opportunity to refocus on cost discipline. It looks like the capital returns by way of buyback remained quite strong in the quarter. Has this affected your thoughts on buybacks and capital returns going forward? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Maybe, stepping back, I would say we are overall seeing strong momentum on YouTube. People are turning to YouTube. Our watchtime has increased across the board. People are also looking for authoritative news content. Viewership on YouTube has increased significantly compared to last year, too. So in many ways, through the pandemic, people are using YouTube. And the trends are global across North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific as well.\nOn direct response, I do think people are -- it's a journey and people who have been investing are seeing that it is cost effective. And so over time, more people are looking at it. Our sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers understand the opportunities there and so being able to bring all of that to bear.\nIn the case of App Campaigns, we have done it with the Universal App Campaigns. So we've just made it easier as a customer not to think about whether you're trying to do this across Search or YouTube and bring a simple, holistic solution. So all of that is impacting.\nI mentioned gaming earlier. When you think about things like unboxing and product reviews, those are a natural home for transactions as well. I earlier mentioned about all the work we are doing now on commerce. All of that, I'm looking forward to those integrations coming into YouTube and working better as well. And so those are some of the longer-term opportunities. We are working hard to get the experience right and building the right foundation for the future.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then on your second question, on capital returns, we believe a share repurchase program for us, appropriately sized, is responsible in the current environment based on our capital allocation framework and our cash balance. So in\n\n the beginning of the year, I indicated that we expected to repurchase shares at a pace at least consistent with the fourth quarter on the remaining authorization. And that remains our view for the second quarter.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Okay. Thanks. In terms of the maybe less worse or somewhat positive trends at the end, you mentioned this recovery or modest move up in consumer commercial search queries. Have you also seen a small improvement in advertiser interest in running campaigns? I think you said both of those factors kind of deteriorated in March. One of them came back. Did the other come back, too? Do you also see advertisers starting to come back? And then, secondly, that YouTube result in the March quarter was phenomenally strong, given what happened in the month of March to YouTube. Was that a comp issue? Was the comp much easier? It sounded like January and February could have been up strong, 40% year-over-year. So is there any color? Is that just comps, easy comps? Or was there something that fundamentally changed that caused that kind of material acceleration? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So as I tried to be really clear in my response to Heather's question, I would not extrapolate from my comments for the full quarter. It's early, just giving you an early read. And there's really not much more to add than what I indicated. So nothing more to add there. And then --\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: And maybe just to reiterate what Ruth said earlier, and I said, that Search tends to -- people respond to changes in Search faster, Brand trails. So Brand is maybe slower to change, both on the downside and the upside, and Search is much faster to adapt as well. And so I think that's worth keeping in mind.\nBut overall, look, we see a vibrant system. Advertisers are definitely very engaged and looking at it. And we are seeing active conversations between our teams and our large advertisers where they are trying to understand the demand shifts and how they can respond.\nAnd so, overall, I see both from users, users that are engaging with Google, YouTube and our core products and services. And while, obviously, there's an impact on the economy and we're not immune to that, the engagement from advertisers across our products and with our teams has been very robust.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2020 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.", "20202": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q2 2020 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q2 2020 Earnings Call July 30, 2020\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Alphabet second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you will need to press star then one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star then zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s second-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, expected to be filed with the SEC later today. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim, and thank you everyone for joining in. It\u2019s certainly been a busy week and I\u2019m glad to be here. I hope everyone is staying safe and well. All of us at Google continue to send our deepest gratitude to everyone on the front lines of the pandemic, all around the world. I also want to personally thank all our employees who continue to work so hard, to make sure our products and services are available for everyone right now - people looking for important health information, hard-hit businesses working to inform customers about opening hours or delivery options, or teachers connecting to their students.\nThe macroeconomic environment caused by the pandemic created headwinds for our business. Our revenue declined on a reported basis and is flat year-over-year on a fixed FX basis. Like other companies, this quarter, we saw the early signs of stabilization, as users returned to commercial activity online. This was true across most of our advertising verticals and geographies. Of course, the economic climate remains fragile.\nOne thing I\u2019d like to call out is our continuing journey to invest in and grow new businesses. We delivered strong growth in our non-ads revenues, particularly from Cloud, Google Play and YouTube subscriptions. This in turn is helping our partners, developers and creators earn revenue and deliver valuable services to people. We are focused on the steps to build long term value with these opportunities. Today I\u2019ll review the quarter by walking through the four key\n\n areas for 2020 that you\u2019ve heard me mention over the last several quarters - creating the most helpful products for everyone, providing the most trusted experiences for our users, executing at scale and creating sustainable value.\nFirst, creating the most helpful products for everyone. This has been especially important during this time. We\u2019ve focused on providing locally relevant, helpful and authoritative information about COVID in over 70 languages and 200 countries. This has been an enormous effort across Search and all our products. YouTube, for example, engaged with public health officials in over 90 countries and surfaces panels with locally relevant information in response to COVID-19 queries. On Google Maps and Search, we now display more than 12,000 COVID-19 testing centers across 20 countries, working with local governments and data providers to source accurate and helpful information.\nUsing our technical capabilities, we\u2019re helping people find more information about local businesses, such as takeout, curbside, updated hours, donations, gift cards and virtual services. With more kids at home, Google Play launched a special Kids tab with only teacher approved apps. And YouTube has seen traction with Learn-at-Home, as well as a virtual summer camp for kids, called \u201cCamp YouTube\u201d, plus a virtual commencement series.\nTo help Indian internet users, we announced the Google for India Digitization Fund. Through this effort, we will invest approximately $10 billion over the next 5-7 years to accelerate and participate in India\u2019s burgeoning digital economy. We\u2019ll enable information in local languages, and apply technology and AI to important areas like health, education and agriculture. Jio Platforms is our first partnership agreement in the fund, and we\u2019ll work with them to help millions of users in India become owners of smartphones.\nSecond, providing trusted experiences for our users. Doing even more to protect users\u2019 privacy, keep information safe and provide high quality information was a key focus this quarter. In one important update, we now set people\u2019s Location History and Web and App Activity to delete automatically after 18 months as the default. We also integrated Password Checkup into our core security checkup to help people detect any instance of their online accounts being compromised. More than 100 million people have used it. Android 11 Beta launched this quarter with many new features to help people better manage their connected devices. It contains a significant focus on privacy and security, including more granular control over app permissions and restrictions on apps\u2019 usage of background location.\nOur exposure notifications API for Android and iOS, developed with Apple, launched this quarter. It\u2019s designed to empower public health agencies to create apps to help fight the spread of COVID, with the strongest user privacy safeguards. As of today, authorities have rolled out official apps in 12 countries to alert people that they were in contact with another person who tested positive for the virus, and that they should isolate and get tested. We expect several more apps to launch in the next week or two, including the first state apps in the U.S.\nWe are also focused on election security efforts around the globe, whether it\u2019s removing coordinated foreign influence operations, preventing hacking and phishing attempts, or enforcing our political ad policies that require transparency and prohibit narrow microtargeting.\n\n Moving on now to executing at scale. All businesses are adjusting to work from home, and we are no exception. While building products across distributed teams wasn\u2019t new for us, this experience allowed us to make good use of our infrastructure investments and productivity tools. G Suite products, in particular Google Meet, have been absolutely critical - and we quickly re-engineered it and made it available widely to help millions of other businesses and organizations connect and collaborate.\nOne area where we\u2019ve executed really well to improve the user and merchant experience in the last year is shopping. We know that we - and merchants - face incredible competition for consumer attention and wallets. We\u2019re helping merchants lower their costs and improve their reach in a few ways. They can now list their products for free on the Google Shopping tab and on Search, helping them drive more traffic, and making our results more comprehensive and useful. We also recently announced that sellers on Buy on Google will no longer pay us a commission fee. Plus, we\u2019re giving retailers more choice by opening our platform to third-party providers \u2014 starting with PayPal and Shopify. Shopping ads also continue to be a great tool for merchants. With new visual features for retailers such as Smart Shopping Campaigns that let customers know about free shipping, we\u2019re continually adding more ways for advertisers to reach shoppers.\nNow let me talk about our fourth area - building sustainable value - which is all about driving business value for our partners and investing smartly in new areas. In our advertising business, our focus is on helping businesses find customers as they work to rebuild and recover.\nWe gave search advertisers the ability to add high-quality images to their ads, helping shoppers quickly see products to consider and take action faster. We added features to make video ads more easily shoppable and browsable on YouTube, as more businesses are shifting to online, to offset physical store closures. For SMBs, we\u2019re proud that so many are taking advantage of new features including Smart campaigns to reach new online audiences, and promoted pins on Google Maps to let customers know that their businesses are open. And to empower businesses to understand, in an easy and visual way, what products people are searching for during the special circumstances that COVID-19 has created, the Rising Retail Categories tool surfaces fast-growing, product-related categories.\nAs I mentioned earlier, beyond advertising revenue, we see good traction, in areas such as YouTube subscriptions, Google Play and Cloud. YouTube Premium, Music and TV subscriptions performed well during the quarter. We\u2019re seeing strong demand for these services, and are adding content regularly including many Viacom networks like BET and Comedy Central. In Q2, Google Play app and game downloads were up more than 35% year over year, which means that revenue for developers continues to grow.\nLet me go a bit deeper on Cloud. In the first half of 2020, technology and innovation proved to be a significant recovery mechanism for businesses. Those who are shifting to digital and embracing a spirit to innovate are evolving and growing. Our commitment to bringing innovative products to market, building and scaling our go-to-market organization, and strengthening our partner network helped us continue to meet the growing needs of our customers this quarter.\nWe see two distinct trends as businesses embrace the future of work. First, the future of business will be more digital. Customers are choosing Google Cloud to either lower their costs\n\n by improving operating efficiency or to drive innovation through digital transformation. Brands like Keurig, Dr. Pepper, Deutsche Bank, Lowe\u2019s, Telefonica, Orange, and Groupe Renault. And we are helping many government agencies deliver care for their citizens including the states of Oklahoma and New York here in the U.S., and Italy and Spain in Europe. Second, the future of work will be more collaborative. Virtual collaboration is critical in order to adapt and succeed in the changing global landscape. In Q2, we saw continued demand from customers using G Suite to help their employees work from home, including Wipro in India and expanded our relationship with the State of Arizona here in the U.S.\nOur customers are using G Suite tools across industries in new ways, whether it be financial advisors working with clients, doctors and nurses turning to telemedicine, or teachers educating students with remote learning. In Q2, we peaked at more than 600 million Meet participants in a single week. As one example, PwC employees reached nearly 10 million hours of video conferencing in Google Meet in a single month. To make collaboration easier for everyone, we introduced an integrated workspace for Gmail, Chat, Meet, and Drive on mobile and desktop. Our Cloud product strategy is differentiated and our investments in direct sales and indirect distribution are beginning to deliver results. Before I move to Other Bets, I want to note that our hardware team continues to make good progress, and I\u2019m excited by the new, upcoming devices we have coming this fall.\nAnd finally, in our Other Bets. Waymo announced that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will work with Waymo as its strategic partner for L4 autonomous technology across their full portfolio. It also entered into a partnership agreement with Volvo Car Group to work together to integrate the Waymo Driver into an all-new electric vehicle platform for ride hailing services. Finally, Waymo closed its externally led investment round, bringing the total funding to $3.2 billion, which includes investment from Alphabet. And Wing\u2019s drone delivery service started delivering library books to students in Virginia.\nIn closing, it\u2019s an important and uncertain time in the world. We\u2019re all grappling with a pandemic and a struggling economy, while also reckoning with centuries of injustice that affect our Black communities every day. John Lewis\u2019 funeral today provides a timely reminder of this struggle.\nIn June, we announced a significant package of commitments to help our Black+ community internally at Google, as well as the wider Black community. This included product experiences that matter to Black users, including the option for business owners to identify their business as Black-owned in Google Maps and Search. We also announced a $175 million economic opportunity package to support Black business owners, startup founders, job seekers and developers, in addition to YouTube\u2019s $100 million fund to amplify Black creators and artists. We commit to contributing to long-term, meaningful change, both externally and within Google. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Sundar. We are cautiously encouraged by our results for the second quarter, although mindful of the fragile global economic environment. Our advertising revenues gradually improved through the quarter, and our non-advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance, particularly Google Cloud and Play. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.\n\n Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our Total Revenues in the second quarter were $38.3 billion, down 2% year-on-year, and flat in constant currency. Year-on-year declines in our advertising revenues from Search and Network were offset by growth in Google Other and Google Cloud revenues. Details of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Across each region we saw gradual improvement in revenues in the quarter, with some differences reflecting product mix. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in approximately a 2% headwind to reported revenues.\nRegarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $18.6 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here, again this quarter, were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs - primarily driven by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services, followed by costs for YouTube\u2019s advertising-supported content.\nOperating expenses were $13.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Headcount growth was the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and G&A. Secondarily, the increase in G&A reflects contributions mainly for COVID response, and reserves for estimated credit losses of our customers. The year-on-year decline in Sales & Marketing expenses was due to lower advertising and promotional spend as we paused or rescheduled campaigns and pivoted to digital formats for flagship events. All three categories benefited from lower T&E expenses.\nStock-based compensation totaled $3.3 billion. Headcount was up 4,450 from the first quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud, for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $6.4 billion, down 30% year-over-year and our operating margin in the quarter was 17%. Other Income & Expense, was $1.9 billion, which primarily reflects an unrealized increase in the market value of equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 15.9%. Net income was $7.0 billion and earnings per diluted share were $10.13.\nTurning now to Capex and operating cash flow. Cash Capex for the quarter was $5.4 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating Cash Flow was $14.0 billion with Free Cash Flow of $8.6 billion. We repurchased $6.9 billion of our shares. We ended the quarter with Cash & Marketable Securities of approximately $121 billion.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment, Revenues were $38.0 billion, down 2% year-over-year. I\u2019ll now go through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google search and other advertising revenues, we generated $21.3 billion in revenues in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year in the aggregate with improvement as the quarter progressed. We saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics throughout the quarter followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. This resulted in an improvement in year-on-year search revenue trends during the quarter, with search revenues essentially flat to last year by the end of June.\n\n YouTube advertising revenues were $3.8 billion, up 6% year-on-year, driven by ongoing substantial growth in direct response, offset by a continued decline in brand advertising which then moderated toward the end of the quarter. Network advertising revenues were $4.7 billion, down 10% year-on-year, with trends improving somewhat toward the end of the quarter as advertiser spend began to return.\nTurning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite, revenues were $3.0 billion for the second quarter, up 43% year-over-year. GCP maintained the strong level of revenue growth it delivered in the first quarter and its revenue growth was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. GCP growth was again led by our Infrastructure offerings and our Data and Analytics platform. Overall the lower Google Cloud revenue growth in the second quarter, relative to the first quarter, reflects the fact that G Suite lapped a price increase that was introduced in April last year. G Suite maintained healthy growth in average revenue per seat as well as in seat growth, which does not include customers who took advantage of our free trials as they shifted their employees to work from home.\nOther Revenues were $5.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the second quarter benefited from the impact of very strong growth in the number of active buyers, with more people at home looking for entertainment. Within YouTube subscription revenues, we continued to benefit from subscriber growth across its various offerings.\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $6.7 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and down 8% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of Total Advertising Revenues was up slightly year-over-year. Google Operating income was $7.6 billion, down 26% versus last year, and the operating margin was 20%. Google Accrued Capex for the quarter was $4.8 billion, reflecting investments in servers, data centers and office facilities. Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the second quarter, revenues were $148 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. The operating loss was $1.1 billion.\nLet me end with our outlook. As I said earlier, ads revenue gradually improved during the quarter across Search, YouTube, and Network. However, we believe it is premature to gauge the durability of recent trends given the obvious uncertainty of the global macro environment. As we discussed on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, global macroeconomic performance has tended to be correlated with ad spend and is a key signal to monitor.\nOver the long term, we remain optimistic about the underlying strength of our business. In terms of Google Cloud, we are pleased with the traction we\u2019re having with large customers who are making multi-year commitments with us. This is reflected in the strength of our backlog, which ended the quarter at $14.8 billion, substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud. This performance is a result of the investments we are making into the Cloud go-to-market organization.\nGoogle Play\u2019s Q2 results reflect growth in the number of new buyers, with accelerated adoption as people stayed home. Performance also reflects the significant investments we have made in the ecosystem to support developers and users, such as successful promotion and adoption of our partners\u2019 apps and games in new locales around the world and expanding the availability of local forms of digital payments.\n\n Moving on to profitability. The decline in our Search revenues put significant pressure on profitability, which was further impacted by our ongoing investments for long term growth. As I discussed last quarter, much of our expense base, both in cost of revenues and opex, is not directly correlated with changes in revenues. For example, although TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of items in Other Cost of Revenues that are generally less variable in nature such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure, as well as for activities like customer support and content review. We remain focused on the user and customer experience and will continue to invest to support our products.\nWith respect to operating expenses, although we still expect the pace of headcount growth to decelerate somewhat in 2020, we\u2019re continuing to hire aggressively in priority areas like Cloud. We still expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in Q3, as we bring on new graduates. Consistent with prior years, we expect Sales and Marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season.\nTurning to Capex, we continue to expect a modest decrease in the level of total Capex in 2020 compared with last year. This is particularly due to our decision to slow the pace at which we acquire office buildings in the near term as we focus on re-imagining the optimal work environment. This also reflects the slower pace of ground up construction for both our office facilities and data centers due to Covid-19. In terms of technical infrastructure, as we discussed last quarter, we anticipate investment to remain at roughly the same level as in 2019 with relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction, and benefiting from our ongoing focus on server efficiency.\nWith respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $28 billion of our Class C Stock. Thank you and Sundar and I will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star then one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can, for Sundar. One, on the commerce initiatives, a lot of announcements from the company in the quarter moving towards sort of commission-free and amplifying both the advertising and the eCommerce efforts. I want to understand some of the moves you are making strategically and how you think that positions you broadly against obviously an eCommerce landscape that\u2019s seeing a lot of pulled-forward penetration given the current environment. And, second, on YouTube, obviously a fairly volatile brand advertising environment and TV advertising remains in flux. What are the opportunities both in the U.S. and globally to go after some of the TV ad budgets under the YouTube umbrella? Thanks so much.\n\n Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On Shopping, I spoke a little bit in my remarks, but really excited at the potential there. Team has been executing very well. Overall, users come to Google a lot to find the products they are looking for. But we see an opportunity to invest and make the experience better. Sometimes the journeys may fail because they don't find what they are looking for, so we want to make sure it's comprehensive.\nNext, when people find what they like, we want to make it simple for them to transact. And so working on that end-to-end experience has been a big focus. And obviously making sure for merchants, really making sure we are open to business for merchants and we are giving value to them -- has been the focus. Early indications are that users are responding positively, both in terms of user engagement and more importantly, giving value back to merchants for their investment there. So in some ways it's a return to our first principles. We want to ensure that Google is the best place for merchants to connect with users. And so I'm excited by it and you'll continue to see us focus in this area.\nThe second was on YouTube brand. Obviously, YouTube has been doing well in terms of engagement and watchtime. And so we see a long-term opportunity there. We've had strength on direct response as well through this quarter. But on brand, which was your question, we are obviously investing not just in YouTube, main product YouTube -- TV as well. And so, areas where we can offer a bundle, advertisers are interested in streaming. And so bringing the bundle together, especially to advertisers and upfronts through YouTube Select is a big opportunity as well. So we are focused on that.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thanks for taking the question. I have two. Just first, Ruth. Curious if you can just talk about the cost structure a little bit more. We know you'll continue to invest to drive growth over the long-term. Just curious how you're thinking about as the top line starts to recover more, hopefully over coming quarters? And then, secondly, I know you said that search trends were flat to last year by the end of June, just curious if there's anything you could add in terms of what you\u2019ve seen more recently over the last month as well? Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thanks for those, Doug. In terms of cost structure, as we talked about last quarter, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency in the near term. And that being said, as Sundar and I both noted, what you are seeing is the fact that we do remain focused on investing for the long-term. So sort of breaking that down, in cost of revenues, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of Other Cost of Revenues that are not directly correlated with revenue growth, as I noted in opening comments. And we are very focused on the user experience in the overall ecosystem. So we are investing to make sure that we are supporting our products so they remain reliable in all environments.\nAnd then in opex, much of our operating expense is generally less variable and not necessarily correlating to revenues in the near term. So in terms of couple of the items, although we do\n\n continue to expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate to decelerate, as I noted, we are hiring aggressively in priority areas like Cloud. And so we're taking near term steps to enhance efficiency but still investing for the long-term.\nSo we're trying to make sure that we're getting those trade-offs -- those trade-offs right. And as I noted, we do expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate in 2020 to be down somewhat from the 20% year-on-year rate last year and that\u2019s even adjusting for two items that put upward pressure on headcount growth. First, we're moving certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operations center that is actually opex neutral but does increase reported spend [sic] [headcount] and, second, the pending acquisition of Fitbit. So we\u2019re trying to navigate it appropriately.\nIn terms of your second question -- in terms of search trends and what we saw throughout the quarter, I would say that following a rough end to the first quarter, Ads revenue gradually improved in the quarter, not only in Search, but YouTube and Network. And so for Search, we ended March at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then as we progressed through the second quarter, we saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics. And that was followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. So that resulted in a gradual improvement in year-on-year Search revenue trends in the second quarter. We ended basically flat to last year by the end of June.\nAnd to carry it forward, although we're pleased that ads revenue gradually improved throughout the quarter, as I said, we do believe it's premature to say that we're out of the woods given the fragile nature of the macro environment. And as you're aware, ad spend does tend to be correlated with macroeconomic performance and so the macro backdrop will continue to be a key signal to monitor. But to your question, based on our estimates from the end of June through last quarter [sic] [week], there has been a modest improvement in July.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thank you for the color, Ruth. Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you so much. I just wanted to ask a question on -- two questions related to Google Cloud, if I could. One, Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us how you\u2019ve seen the change in pace of customers migrating workloads to the cloud given COVID? And I'm also wondering if you can share with us kind of the puts and takes? And Microsoft talked about this a little bit last week with their Azure business, but for those that have accelerated workload migration to the cloud, how much has that offset the impacted industries or companies that you might be serving where they\u2019re seeing lower utilization than what they normally do with cloud capacity -- so if you can kind of talk about the puts and takes to the growth as well, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Heather. Overall, from my vantage point, obviously with Google Cloud, we've been investing to scale up especially on the people side, on engineering, go to market, and then obviously on our investment side with data centers, cloud\n\n regions, and so on. And so for me, it's been good to see as we are scaling up, we are executing more effectively. I've been personally involved in many, many conversations last quarter. We had many large customers come onto Cloud, big telco deals and banking deals. Deutsche Bank as an example. So overall, I felt the momentum was strong. Generally felt like things were continuing well through the course. Felt like more secular interest in digital transformation -- companies are deeply thinking long-term and planning for it. So overall, I felt that the momentum was there. And I felt our execution as we are scaling up, obviously we're scaling up a lot, and so it's -- the combination is working well.\nYour second question in terms of puts and takes, overall I think there are -- I don't know whether there's anything significant worth me highlighting. Obviously you are right to point out that it doesn't affect everyone the same. But nothing significant for me to highlight here today.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you so much.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Sundar, we try to always figure out changes in consumer behavior. I guess as you have sort of been studying what people have been doing through shelter in place and from the way things are changing from a consumer perspective, talk to us about areas you're most focused on investing in and driving your teams to create new products to really help consumers with their changing habits. And then the second one, Ruth, as we sort of look ahead with potentially a larger percentage of the workforce work remote or work from home, without looking for quantification, maybe just talk to us about some puts and takes or areas where you can see either efficiency or higher potential cost from a larger percentage of the workforce being remote over the long term. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On the first one, there is -- the shift to online is profound. We see people engaging a lot, doing newer things than they did before. People's interests are broadening, I would say, across the board. And so, for example, for me I'm looking at different types of user journeys and making sure each of them is getting deeper and better. So, for example, in Google, as people have started coming for more health-related information, how is that experience working, thinking about that for the long term and investing in it. I obviously spoke about Shopping earlier, and that's been a big focus for us. Education, in general.\nAnd when we think through small, medium businesses and bigger companies, thinking through collaboration, where G Suite's potential is, the investments we are undertaking, all that is very exciting to me. But I would say cutting underneath all that, maybe while we didn't talk about it -- really focused on our AI teams doing the investments they need, evolving our next-generation TPUs. And the teams building better models and better algorithms. All that, I think our ability to do more things is something I'm really interested in and focused on as well. So that's something I'm excited about for the longer term.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And then in terms of your question about work from home, I think it's a great point, because it obviously feeds so much into a lot of the product work\n\n that we're doing in Cloud through G Suite, et cetera. So that's where I would actually start. But I appreciate what you're asking is -- how are we looking at our own cost base. And we called that out last quarter in particular with respect to capex. And you can sort of see it here this quarter. The main change in capex has really been we slowed the pace on the office facilities front and what we're looking at is really how to reimagine what the workplace will look like.\nWe continue to be very much focused on the fact that place and space are important. We believe in collaboration. Serendipity is key to innovation, so we do view space and office as important and are very focused on what does that mean over the long term. We've actually opened quite a number of our offices, in fact, in 40 countries, and do hope to reopen in many more. But your question to what does it mean for overall cost structure, we're looking at that, and the place you see it now is in our capex and the way we've been looking at it and our indication that we do expect 2020 will be lower capex on the facilities side as a result.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thank you. I was just curious if you could just comment in terms of some of the near-term business trends and anything that's changed as you've gone through the month of July versus what you saw in June.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Sure. I already commented on that with respect to Search. But to broaden it a bit more -- and again, this is based on estimates from the end of June through last week. So, for YouTube, we ended March with a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits. And that's reflecting a substantial headwind from brand. The headwind from brand moderated modestly at the end of the second quarter, and then we saw a further improvement in July. Direct response has been consistently strong.\nFor Network, revenues improved toward the end of the second quarter, and we have seen a further slight improvement in July. Obviously, three weeks is not a quarter, but that's based on the estimates here from the end of June.\nAnd then as Sundar and I both said, when you look at, for example, Cloud, it has maintained its strength consistently. And I'd say that with a business that's growing at this pace, it's really much more about a secular trend to the move to cloud, so really nothing to comment on there.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks for the color.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of\nAmerica. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Great. Sundar, I don't know how much you can comment on the regulatory environment, but it's obviously top of mind with the hearings yesterday. Maybe just characterize it for Google right now, and are you seeing any progress with the regulatory environment? And then, secondly, we saw the YouTube TV price increase. Pretty interesting business model. But, longer term, do you see that as really strategically\n\n important for the YouTube brand or do you think you can have a really profitable business on that? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On the regulatory front, we've obviously been operating under scrutiny for a while. And we realize at our scale, that's appropriate. And we\u2019ve engaged constructively across jurisdictions. And from my standpoint, I'm confident in the approach we take -- our focus on users, and the evidence in almost all areas we operate in -- we expand choice, overall lower prices, and it's -- overall, there's a very fast pace of innovation. So it's dynamic and competitive. Having said that, obviously, we will operate based on the rules. And so to the extent there are any areas where we need to adapt, we will. And as a company, I think we will be -- I think being flexible around those things is important I think. I think the scrutiny is going to be here for a while. And so we are committed to working through it.\nOn the second question, around YouTube -- YouTube TV -- it's a good question. I spoke earlier about even from a brand and how people think about it, they are interested in streaming. So as YouTube TV gets more scale, I think we will see more opportunities there. We are obviously still in the early stages of building out the product. And just recently, we've added a bunch of new channels and making sure it's working well. In the U.S., the TV market is a big part of the advertising market too. So overall, if we can invest here and scale up, I think the synergies with YouTube will become more meaningful over time. And so excited at the traction the product is getting, but still too early.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from\nEvercore. Your line is now open.\nKevin Rippey (Evercore ISI): Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This one is for Sundar. I was hoping you might be able to expand on the earlier comment you made about the AI strategy. I'm particularly wondering if there's been things over the past five months, since the pandemic begun, that you thought expansion of your AI strategy or an evolution of AI strategy might be able to solve for, whether that relates to search commercialization or monetization or, really, anything across the business. Just really, really curious. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: An area which -- first of all, across the board, the progress is steep. So I'm very happy with the pace at which our R&D on AI is progressing. And for me, it's important that we are state of the art as a company and we're leading. And to me, I'm excited at the pace at which our engineering and R&D teams are working, both across Google and DeepMind. So I'm excited about it. Specifically, we are making good progress in areas like language understanding. And you saw some improvements last year, significant improvements with BERT in Search. But BERT took us a few years to get there. But things like that, I see more stuff in the future. And so excited by it.\nAn area where I think we are still under tapped vis-\u00e0-vis potential is definitely Cloud. We see the potential there. And I think it's related to Heather's question too. I think companies are thinking about migrating workloads and so on. But the longer-run opportunity of actually using AI to truly have business solutions for you, for whatever industry you are in, that's the aspect there is a lot of potential and we are still very early there. And so part of it is, for us, connecting the dots\n\n internally and bringing it as solutions to our users. We have done it in certain product areas. But I see it as a bigger opportunity in the future.\nKevin Rippey (Evercore ISI): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler, from\nBarclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Great. I just had two questions. First, on YouTube subscription, so can you talk about the size of that area of the business relative to that $15 billion, we had it at about 15% of total YouTube revenue. And then how is the faster growth in that area relative to advertising impacting your long-term profitability goals at YouTube? And then, the second question is on Search. So it sounds like the flat exit run rate year-on-year is pretty encouraging. If we strip out travel, I'm guessing it's well above that. So how would you characterize the query growth versus just the ad auction dynamics outside of travel across the other categories? Are we back to pre-COVID levels in those areas? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of the first question, we haven't broken out the specifics within the YouTube subscription revenues. YouTube subscriptions are in Other Revenues, it's not in Advertising Revenues. And overall, as we think about the opportunity -- our view is -- and we talked about this when we were launching the subscription product. It was really responsive to what we were hearing from users. And as we look at it, music is a key part of the overall YouTube experience. It's an important component of watchtime. And what we found is that users wanted a -- they wanted choice. And some wanted a premium YouTube experience with ad-free viewing and the ability to download songs and videos. And that was really the impetus.\nIn addition, YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams for music labels and publishers. So, for example, in 2019 YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. And what we've done is meaningfully ramp our geographic presence from five countries in the beginning of 2018 to 94 countries today. And earlier this year, we announced that YouTube Premium had more than 20 million paid subscribers, up more than 60% versus the prior year. So our subscriber numbers have continued to grow there, and it really was driven by the goal to give users choice.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thanks very much. I guess maybe a follow up to the earlier question on commerce. Beyond the marketplace functionality and some of the free or promotional transactions, I wonder how some of the other initiatives are going to play a role? And things I'm thinking specifically are where you were focused before on Google Checkout, and Maps, and some of the Assistant functionality, how those may play a changing role in commerce on the Google platform. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Great question. I think the bar is to have that super simple experience, which is delightful and that you have peace of mind and satisfaction in terms of getting the product and being able to return it and so on. So the end-to-end funnel\n\n matters a lot. And part of the reason why through the changes -- a couple of things we've done, as you saw, we changed and we removed the commission for merchants to be on the platform. And part of it is -- by removing that, they can take that and invest in, be it shipping, be it delivery, be it the customer experience. And so that matters -- I think, the overall experience.\nAnd from our standpoint, the Buy on Google experience is something, which deeply investing in. Obviously our integrations with PayPal, our investments underlying it to make sure for a lot of users that it's as close to a one-click experience as possible is a big part of the investment as well.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney\nfrom RBC. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Okay, thanks. I want to ask a broad question about Google -- Google's place or position in online retail. And I ask this because Google\u2019s obviously been central -- Search has been central, but also YouTube has been central to commerce -- online commerce for the last 20 years. We've gone through this pandemic where there's a real inflection point. We see it in Amazon's results. We see it in Shopify's results. And I'm not sure I see it in Google's results. So just talk about how you think broadly Google is positioned for what's really been like a two- or three-year pull-forward in accelerated ramp-up of online retail demand. And are you positioned the way you want to be positioned now? Are there things you need to\nmake -- changes that you need to make to products and services to be better positioned? Thanks a lot.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Obviously, I think as a company our strength comes from diverse categories in which we serve users, right? And it's not just products, it's services. It's wide areas including areas like travel. So it's diversified. And -- but it also means through a pandemic, there are areas of strength but there are areas where you get impacted as well. So I think that's what is reflected in what you see.\nOn eCommerce, you're right, there are eCommerce providers that are seeing a big inflection point. But in it are essential categories like groceries and stuff which are built in, which we don't directly play in. But to us, the reason we are doing this long-term focused effort on shopping with the new leadership team is to precisely make sure as a platform we are improving and as the shift continues, Google continues to be an important place by which people come and participate in those journeys. So long-run, I see a growth opportunity with related to what we are investing in, in there as well, not just through Search -- but Search and the Shopping investments we are making -- but in YouTube, and also helping retailers on the Cloud side. It's an area where there's naturally a lot of interest to work -- to partner with Google. And so we see that as a big opportunity as well.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thank you, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for\ntoday. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.\n\n Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We know you all have a busy evening. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2020 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.", "20203": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q3 2020 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q3 2020 Earnings Call October 29, 2020\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Alphabet third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you will need to press star then one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star then zero. I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s third-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, expected to be filed with the SEC later today. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Given the busy schedule this afternoon, we\u2019ve shortened our opening remarks so that we can move more quickly to take your questions. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This quarter, our performance was consistent with the broader online environment. It\u2019s also a testament to the investment we\u2019ve made to improve search and deliver a highly relevant experience that people turn to for help in moments big and small. We saw an improvement in advertiser spend across all geographies and most of our verticals. With the world accelerating its transition to online and digital services, in Q3 we also saw strength in Google Cloud, Play and YouTube subscriptions.\nThis is the third quarter we\u2019re reporting earnings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to information has never been more important. This year, including this quarter, showed how valuable Google\u2019s founding product, Search, has been to people. And importantly, our products and investments are making a real difference as businesses work to recover and get back on their feet. Whether it\u2019s finding the latest information on COVID-19 cases in their area, which local businesses are open or what online courses will help them prepare for new jobs, people continue to turn to Google Search. You can now find useful information about offerings like \u201cno-contact delivery\u201d or \u201ccurbside pick up\u201d for 2 million businesses on Search and Maps. And we\u2019ve used Google\u2019s Duplex AI technology to make calls to businesses and confirm things like temporary closures. This has enabled us to make 3 million updates to business information globally.\n\n We know that people\u2019s expectations for instant, perfect search results are high. That\u2019s why we continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful Search experience possible. Two weeks ago, we announced a number of Search improvements, including our biggest advancement in our spelling systems in over a decade, a new approach to identifying key moments in videos, and one of people\u2019s favorites: hum to search, which will identify a song and artist based only on humming.\nWe also announced that BERT, a huge breakthrough in natural language understanding that we introduced last year, now improves results for almost every English Search query. We\u2019re also investing in improving the shopping experience in Search, to help people find the best products and prices available, from a wide range of merchants. We recently added easy-to-see price comparisons to help consumers know if they\u2019re getting a good deal. We\u2019ve also improved our features like price tracking, so people can request an alert if there\u2019s a discount on a product they\u2019re following.\nThese investments are also benefiting merchants and advertisers and helping them recover. As of today, merchants can list products for free on our Shopping tab in 48 countries around the world. For advertisers, we\u2019ve recently announced a new Insights Page in Google Ads to help businesses better understand consumer trends and track current search demand for products or services.\nWe\u2019re also investing to create improved search experiences that provide additional value to news publishers. We recently committed $1 billion in investments that include licensing content from national, regional and local news publishers for Google News Showcase, a new product that features the editorial curation of award-winning newsrooms. We\u2019ve signed partnerships with nearly 200 publications around the world, with more to come.\nWe know our success in search is not guaranteed. We are proud that people choose Google Search, not because they have to, but because it\u2019s helpful. We remain committed to investing to build the most helpful, most trusted Search experience, just as we have for the last 22 years. On that note, regarding the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit, we believe that our products are creating significant consumer benefits, and we\u2019ll confidently make our case. Our company\u2019s focus remains on continuing our work to build a Search product that people love and value.\nMoving on to other parts of our business this quarter. In Hardware, we highlighted some great new products available for the holidays. Our new Pixel phones bring together the very best of Google\u2019s hardware, software and AI at an affordable price with new camera and Assistant features. And our latest Chromecast now comes with Google TV, which brings together movies, shows, and live TV from across apps and subscriptions, and organizes them for you. We\u2019re pleased with the positive reviews and we have a terrific product roadmap ahead.\nOn to YouTube. People come to YouTube for entertainment, information and opportunities to learn something new. As a sign of the times, views for guided meditation videos are up 40% since mid-March, while DIY face-mask tutorials have been viewed over one billion times. YouTube subscriptions also continue to grow. YouTube now has over 30 million Music and Premium paid subscribers, and over 35 million including those on free trials. YouTube TV now has more than 3 million paid subscribers.\n\n Next, Cloud. Three trends are driving the continued momentum of our Cloud business. First, as the shift to digital accelerates, Google Cloud continues to provide a foundation for data processing and analytics, one of the fastest growing segments of the market. BigQuery, which provides real-time and predictive analytics, is winning retailers like Best Buy, helping them create better experiences for shoppers. Customers value our differentiated AI/ML-based industry specific solutions. This is leading to significant wins with brands like Unilever, Amwell and Reckitt Benckiser. Additionally, we\u2019re working with government agencies like the U.S. Navy to modernize maintenance operations for vessels and facilities. We\u2019re also partnering with the Defense Innovation Unit, part of the U.S. Department of Defense, to help military doctors with cancer detection research. And recently, we signed an enterprise agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to help scale research efforts and innovate across national labs and field sites.\nSecond, customers are increasingly moving to the cloud to drive efficiencies and lower IT costs. Our strength in multi-cloud is an advantage here. This is helping us win large data center and IT transformation deals, like Nokia, which recently announced it\u2019s migrating and modernizing approximately 30 data centers across 12 countries onto Google Cloud.\nAnd third, the future of work is creating a more collaborative world. Customers are looking to support hybrid work environments, and we\u2019re seeing significant growth in demand. Earlier this month, we announced Google Workspace, which brings together all of our communication and collaboration apps and ensures they work better together. This is helping organizations like the State of West Virginia and shipping company, Ocean Network Express, improve collaboration and productivity for their employees. Google Workspace continues to grow. For example, Google Meet saw a peak in Q3 of 235 million daily meeting participants and more than 7.5 billion daily video call minutes.\nFinally, in our Other Bets, Waymo announced that its fully autonomous ride-hailing service in suburban Phoenix will open to the public, making it the only company to offer a fully autonomous service for riders. Waymo also entered into a strategic global partnership with Daimler Trucks to enable fully autonomous trucking.\nBefore I close, I want to reiterate our four key areas of focus, which you\u2019ve heard me talk about all year. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. Our investments in Search, Maps, and Shopping that I discussed earlier as well as YouTube are prime examples. Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. We continue to work hard to keep users safe and put them in control of their information. Every day, Gmail blocks more than 100 million phishing attempts and Google Play Protect scans over 100 billion apps for malware and other issues. Third, executing at scale productively, securely and collaboratively. And finally, creating sustainable value, which means creating financially viable and self-sustaining products.\nBefore I hand over to Ruth, one important update. Starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2020, we will break out Google Cloud as a separate reporting segment. I\u2019m working with Ruth and Thomas Kurian to make investment decisions to drive progress here. As we\u2019ve told you on these calls, given the progress we\u2019re making, and the opportunity for Google Cloud in this growing global market, we continue to invest aggressively to build our go-to-market capabilities, execute against our product roadmap, and extend the global footprint of our\n\n infrastructure. With this segmentation, you will additionally see information about the scale of our investments, which should help you gauge the progress we are making on the multi-year path ahead to create sustainable value.\nThanks to all the Googlers around the world for everything you\u2019re doing to help our users and partners. I hope everyone stays safe and let me reiterate my gratitude to essential workers, healthcare providers, first responders, teachers and scientists everywhere. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Sundar. We are very pleased by our results in the third quarter, which reflect both broad-based increases in advertiser spending in Search and YouTube, as well as ongoing strength in our non-advertising revenue lines, in particular Google Cloud and Play. Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our Total Revenues in the quarter were $46.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year, and up 15% in constant currency.\nOur total cost of revenues was $21.1 billion, up 20% year-on-year, primarily driven by Other cost of revenues which was $13.0 billion, and up 29% year-over-year. The biggest factors here, again this quarter, were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; and then content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube\u2019s advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription service content.\nOperating expenses were $13.8 billion, up 1% year-on-year, reflecting both the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID as well as lapping a $554 million legal settlement in the third quarter of 2019. In terms of the three component parts of opex, first, the deceleration in R&D growth was due primarily to slower headcount. Second, the year-on-year decline in Sales & Marketing expenses reflects a planned reduction in advertising and promotional spend that we implemented toward the end of the first quarter. Third, G&A growth reflects the lapping of the settlement. All three categories benefited from lower T&E expenses due to COVID.\nHeadcount was up 4,623 from the second quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud, for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $11.2 billion, up 22% year-over-year and our operating margin in the quarter was 24%.\nOther Income & Expense, was $2.1 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $11.2 billion. Operating Cash Flow was $17.0 billion with Free Cash Flow of $11.6 billion in the quarter and $34 billion in the trailing twelve months. We ended the third quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results.\nStarting with our Google segment, Total Google Revenues were $46.0 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Google search and other advertising revenues were $26.3 billion in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year as advertiser spend began to pick up in August. YouTube advertising revenues were $5.0 billion, up 32% year-on-year, driven by ongoing substantial growth in direct response, followed by a rebound in brand advertising from increased spending by advertisers. Network advertising revenues were $5.7 billion, up 9% year-on-year.\n\n Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and Google Workspace, which was previously known as G Suite. Revenues were $3.4 billion for the third quarter, up 45% year-over-year. GCP maintained the very strong level of revenue growth it delivered in the second quarter and its revenue growth rate was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by seat growth, followed by growth in average revenue per seat.\nOther Revenues were $5.5 billion, up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the third quarter benefited primarily from an increase in the number of active buyers, as well as increased spend per buyer. Within YouTube subscription revenues, we continued to benefit from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Google Operating income was $12.6 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%. As to our Other Bets, revenues in the third quarter were $178 million. The operating loss was $1.1 billion.\nLet me end with our outlook. Regarding revenues, in the third quarter, we benefited from a broad-based improvement in advertiser spend across all geographies and nearly all verticals. This is reflected in both Search results as well as the rebound in brand advertising spend on YouTube. While we\u2019re pleased with our performance in the third quarter, there is obviously uncertainty in the external environment. In terms of Google Cloud, we\u2019re pleased with the consistent strong revenue growth that you saw again this quarter, reflecting the extraordinary secular trend under way. And, with respect to Other Revenues, the primary driver of growth was Play, where revenue growth reflected elevated engagement during the pandemic on top of strong underlying growth. There are signs that user behavior is beginning to return to normalized levels.\nMoving on to profitability. We are pleased with the improvement in profitability versus the prior quarter, reflecting both the revenue performance versus Q2 as well as the tactical adjustments we made to slow down certain categories of spend in response to COVID. In particular, the deceleration in headcount growth this quarter reflects the actions we took at the outset of the pandemic to focus hiring on our highest priority areas like Google Cloud. Excluding the impact of closing the pending Fitbit acquisition, we expect a moderate further deceleration in the pace of headcount growth in the fourth quarter.\nWe also saw the impact of steps we took to slow down some categories of marketing spend. In the third quarter, Sales and Marketing expenses declined year-on-year, primarily due to a planned slow down in ads & promo. We expect a more moderated year-on-year decline in Sales & Marketing in the fourth quarter as we increase spend sequentially to support product launches and the holiday season.\nTurning to Capex, once again this quarter, we had a year-on-year decline in investments primarily due to a reduced pace of real estate acquisitions which we implemented at the outset of the pandemic. Servers continued to be the largest driver of investment in the third quarter, followed by data centers. Our Capex outlook for the full year has not changed as we continue to expect a modest decrease in 2020 compared with last year.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on making the right investments to support growth. As Sundar said in his opening comments, we continue to invest where we see the potential to\n\n create long-term sustainable financial value, including investing aggressively to support growth in Cloud. In addition, given the acceleration in digital transformation, we are focused on ensuring that we remain well positioned to deliver for users and advertisers in this evolving environment. Thank you. Sundar and I will now take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star, then one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Question, maybe I can ask two of Sundar on a high level. You called out some of the innovation you were aiming for with the medium-to-long-term with respect to Search. Can you take a step back and maybe give us your sense of how Search is going to evolve from the product it is today, where there's a lot of input by the user, to sort of the push dynamic with the Discover feed and Discovery Ads and things that could drive both engagement and monetization across your platform. And the second part of the question was, it seems that you're taking a little bit of a different tactic with your hardware strategy this year. There was a little bit less of it, and it was more on the mid-to-lower end of the price range of hardware. How does hardware and broadly tying the Assistant into the hardware strategy fit broadly, Sundar, into your view for where Search is going for the medium-to-long-term? Thanks so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Eric. Good questions. On Search, you're right. Today, particularly with mobile and with ambient computing, that is, you having access to computing across other form factors, I think information both - you go looking for it and there are times it's important that you have relevant information at your fingertips. So I do think about it as a holistic user journey. And obviously, in Search, we'll continue to evolve. Discover has been very good in terms of Discover and YouTube. Both play a role in making sure people are getting relevant information. And I think for us, it's important holistically we're meeting users' information needs, and out of which the monetization opportunity also works as well. So this is why be it Discover or be it how we pick up on YouTube, all of that matters for us.\nOn your second question, on hardware, I'm excited about the -- we are doing some deeper investments in hardware, which are -- some of it takes two to three years to come together. And so I'm excited at the terrific roadmap ahead. I think we have definitely shown with Pixel 4a, Pixel 5, a clear value proposition. And we'll build on that.\nOur portfolio, we are thoughtfully thinking about what are the important form factors which matter. And we do think about it with the view of where Search and Assistant will be important as well. So in many ways, hardware is there to strategically benefit both how we guide the Android ecosystem. How do we make sure information is right there at users' fingertips? So those are both strategic views we take into it as well. But I'm excited about the roadmap ahead. And next year, you will see us lean more into -- some of our deeper investments will come into play there.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\n Doug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, we appreciate the incremental color on 3Q and 4Q expenses. Just hoping that you could help us understand the cost structure a little bit more kind of as we're coming out of this, and just whether you're anticipating any more notable changes just coming out of the pandemic, kind of around the sustainability of the margin improvements that you saw in this quarter. Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thanks for that, Doug. So, as I said, as a result of COVID, we did make tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spend in certain categories. And that started late in the first quarter. And, in part, that's what you see here, plus the impact from the improvements in revenue performance. And we do remain focused on optimizing efficiency where we can. We've said that on many prior calls. But as we've also discussed with you on prior calls, as both Sundar and I noted today, we are committed to making the right investments to support long term profitable growth.\nAnd I think what's exciting in this environment, there appears to be an acceleration in digital transformation that underscores the importance of the products and services that we provide and the longer term opportunities. So we will continue to invest to best position us for the long term opportunity. An obvious example is Cloud. We do intend to maintain a high level of investment, given the opportunity we see. That includes the ongoing increases in our go-to-market organization, our engineering organization, as well as the investments to support the necessary capex. So, hopefully, that gives you a bit more color there.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from\nGoldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Sundar, I had a question for you. Just, Thomas has been the head of Google Cloud now for around two years, if I remember correctly. I'm just wondering, what do you see as the biggest changes he's put into place that has allowed the business to start gaining what appears to be materially more share? And as you look ahead to 2021 and what's going on with digital transformation, what would you say his top strategic priorities would be? Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Heather. A couple of things stand out for me. I think it's been a very consistent, focused strategy, so the focus on the five major geographies, the four customer segments, and the six priority industries: healthcare, retail, financial services, media and entertainment, manufacturing and public sector. That focus and going deeper and scaling our go-to-market both in terms of our people, our partners -- I think that's been key.\nThe second thing I would say is, some of the key differentiators are playing out particularly as we have taken them deeper as unique industry solutions. So going deeper and having solutions. And in some of those cases where we are now pricing based on value. I think that kind of deep, deep, deeper play is something I'm very excited about. Definitely have strength in -- just based on our underlying technologies; so we do have differentiation in areas like data analytics, AI, et cetera. So that's been -- so that's been huge as well.\n\n But I'm pleased with the execution. Obviously, there is a time lag between when you hire the sales and when we train and when you enable them to be more productive. And that's the investments Ruth has been talking about. And I can see it ramping, and I can see the results come into play. So credit towards that focus and execution. And so looking forward to the next phase.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you very much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks for covering and best wishes.\nHeather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, I wanted to ask one about eCommerce specifically. It seems to become increasingly competitive within the eCommerce funnel. So maybe talk to us about -- one, what types of consumer behavior changes are you seeing within eCommerce search on the platform? And then, in your mind, what are the key priorities of investment you need to really execute on to ensure you stay at the top of the funnel within eCommerce? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: I think things that stand out, first of all, I'm excited at the set of announcements and progress we have had in the last few months. And, obviously, we are really focused on the user experience. And we want to make sure, as a consumer, you have wide, comprehensive, high quality inventory and offerings and experience on the platform. Our free shopping listings, which we launched in the U.S., is now available in 48 countries around the world. Additionally, we eliminated commission fees so for the Buy on Google checkout option. Opened the platform up to PayPal, Shopify for integration as well. So that gives rise to comprehensiveness, and we are focused on quality there.\nIn terms of the funnel and behavior, to me what's interesting is, obviously, Search captures the intent of the moment. And the breadth of Search, I think, has been a real asset. And both, as users adapt, advertisers adapt too. So you can see the dynamic play in realtime. But you do see -- I would say YouTube is an important platform for eCommerce as well. I can see advertisers in YouTube at the mid-funnel level, even currently if that's not the intent at that moment, invest to create demand, create interest and so on. So for us, we see commerce working across the platform, and I think that's an opportunity. And then making sure the rest of the experience is good for users is something we are deeply focused on.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks, Sundar.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Good afternoon. Ruth, you called out brand advertisers coming back to YouTube. I'm just curious if you can give us a sense of where you're seeing that strength and kind of where you are at relative to pre-COVID levels with those advertisers.\n\n Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So overall, we're pleased at the degree to which advertisers really have reactivated their budgets in the third quarter. They're reacting in part to, I think, evidence that consumers are showing strong demand across nearly all verticals. It's everything from home and garden to computer to work from home. And so very helpful there.\nAnd then YouTube's strong watchtime growth enables advertisers to reach audience that they can't reach on TV, as we've often talked about. So they're increasingly looking to us to help them reach people who are going to YouTube to learn new topics and engage with fresh, entertaining content, great, great unique content. So it's been an opportunity. We're pleased to have seen the performance in the third quarter here.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin Post from\nBank of America. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Great. Thank you so much. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, thanks for the update on the DOJ. As you think about all the regulators all over the world, is there any hope of coming to a middle ground here? How are you thinking about how far apart you guys are in different regions? And then maybe for Ruth, on the YouTube opportunity, if you assume about 2 billion users, you're on a run rate of maybe $10 per user. I was just wondering how you're thinking about the monetization. Are you still very early? And if you can give us any help on what the margins might look like. Thank you.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Ruth, why don't you go ahead.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So, look, in terms of YouTube, as I said, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum that you see in the revenue line. I think as we've talked to you about quite frequently, in our ad supported business within YouTube, we do pay out a majority of revenues to all of our content creators. We pay all of the infrastructure and networking costs -- that's for storing, for serving video, otherwise for running YouTube. And that includes marketing, supporting content creators.\nThere's quite a bit more that we think is invaluable for creators in the overall ecosystem to make sure we're creating not only great experiences for users and creators, but really the right overall ecosystem. And we've talked about that in the context of how we invest to protect -- protect the content that people are seeing. Content moderation investments we view as really an invaluable part of what we're doing and critically important. So we're continuing to support that -- do view the experience that both creators and users have as just really differentiated as a result.\nAnd then on the subscription side, we're continuing to build it out. As Sundar noted in his opening comments. Both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV do have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of revenues than YouTube ads. And we are early there continuing to build out that subscriber base.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: And just on the regulatory front, scrutiny is not\n\n new for us. And in some ways, it's now sector wide, and not surprisingly so. We will engage constructively, where possible. And as we've shown through some of the past cases, when there is -- we're confident about the benefits we bring to our users. We'll make our case. Where there is feedback or rulings, we'll be flexible and adapt. And so we're building that into it.\nI think while there's a lot on the legislative and regulatory front, as some of this gets resolved, it also creates certainty and, in some cases, clarity and opportunities as well. And so that's the framework with which we approach it. And we'll take a long term view towards it. But at the end of the day, what's in our control is our ability to relentlessly focus on users and build great products, and that's where most of our energy will go into.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney\nfrom RBC. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Thanks. Two questions, please. It sounds like you're going to provide more disclosure on Google Cloud in the fourth quarter. Will that also be on the profitability of Google Cloud, or could you address the question of whether Google Cloud has reached a point of scale where it's no longer dilutive to overall margins? And then briefly, two new revenue opportunities or growing revenue opportunities over the year, Google Maps and the Discover tab. Any update or any new data points that suggest a monetization opportunity with those two assets? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So thanks for that, Mark. When we break out Cloud, we will be also reporting, not just the fourth quarter results, but we'll be providing full year results for 2018, '19 and '20. We'll be providing not just the revenue disaggregation data that we expanded earlier this year, but we will be adding operating income for each of our segments, which we think is the most relevant data.\nAnd the point that both Sundar and I have underscored is that we are investing aggressively in Cloud, given the opportunity that we see. And, frankly, the fact that we were later relative to peers, we're encouraged, very encouraged, by the pace of customer wins and the very strong revenue growth in both GCP and Workspace. We do intend to maintain a high level of investment to best position ourselves. And I kind of went through some of those items, the go-to-market team, the engineering team, and capex. And so we describe this as a multi-year path because we do believe we're still early in this journey.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On Maps and Discover, et cetera. Again, I think I spoke a little bit earlier about thinking it through more holistically. An example where we, I think, worked well is as developers were looking to promote apps with our Universal App Campaigns, you could really reach across. And it's a good model to think about. Recently, for example, to serve small and medium businesses, we expanded Smart Campaigns to 150 countries. And if you're a small business owner, you can set up your first campaign, create your first ad in 15 minutes from your mobile device.\nSo, for me, thinking about these surfaces as -- we'll do the hard work to make sure the most relevant information gets -- and thinking about it more holistically, and I think gives us a chance\n\n to also engage users in the way they want us to. Sometimes when they come looking for it and sometimes when they proactively want information given to them. And so that's the overall view, and I think the opportunity is very exciting ahead.\nMark Mahaney (RBC): Okay. Thank you very much.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon\nfrom BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon (BMO Capital Markets): Great. Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in his response to the DOJ's lawsuit, Kent Walker compared your Search partnerships to how a cereal brand might pay a supermarket to be at the end of the row or at eye level. We've also heard Philipp Schindler talk about your addressable market being potentially twice as large as commonly viewed. And maybe that includes things like those payments inside supermarkets. So my question is two part. Firstly, is it fair to tie those two types of comments together and assume that they're related to each other? And then, second, could you maybe talk about how that might matter to your bigger picture thinking about the advertising and commerce opportunity for Google and in particular the competitive environment you face?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Dan, at a high level, stepping back from it all, we are -- our mission is to provide information. The competitive environment we face is,\nparticularly with mobile, when users are looking for information, there's so many choices they have. And so the question is, making sure Google is a relevant way by which they get that information. And you can imagine when people are looking to buy products, all the competitors that exist, travel, booking hotels or, any category you take. And so for us, that's why I talk about holistically competing and making sure we can provide relevant information as both the competition we face for mindshare and that's the opportunity we have ahead.\nIn terms of specifics of the DOJ case and stuff, I'm confident we've approached everything both with a view of making sure we create the best user experience. And, B, we really want -- we've always built Google for everyone; so we want it to be available on all platforms and be convenient for users to access our services and, as part of that, partner with other companies in doing so. And so, look forward to making our case there. But it's definitely early days, and we are still reviewing and understanding -- understanding it all. And I'm sure we'll update more as time goes by.\nDan Salmon (BMO): Okay. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian\nfrom Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thanks. I have a couple here as well. Maybe just a follow up on the Shopping question. Specifically on YouTube, if you could expand on the role that Shopping and Shopping ads are now playing in the growth strategy there. And on Google Workspace, it seems like this is a unique opportunity, with work from home to really drive adoption and monetization of these services, including Meet, as well as bundling with Cloud services. So wonder if you can provide any more detail on levels of usage and engagement you're seeing with those applications and how you plan to monetize those going forward. Thank you.\n\n Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Great. On Shopping and YouTube, I would definitely say we are on the earlier part of the journey. But we have seen the strength in YouTube for direct response and on a few other categories. And I think -- I think the experiences we see there I think can directly carry over to commerce as we build out the experience. So I see that as an opportunity.\nI earlier also mentioned about, while Search is currently capturing the intent at that given time, YouTube advertisers can take a longer term view, create brand awareness, create interest and so on. So that also offers opportunities. So we today in many, many categories have creators with very compelling content. And I've always felt things work well if you match user interest and it's very relevant to users. And so I think commerce -- there is a lot of commercial activity on YouTube organically. And so I see it as a long term opportunity.\nOn Google Workspace, I'm very excited. We both have strong growth. I mentioned Meet metrics earlier, that we saw a peak of 235 million daily meeting participants in Q3 and more than 7.5 billion daily video call minutes. Definitely significant growth in Meet as well as our other products, like Docs, Drive and Chat. But Google Workspace also now creates that unified experience. And I think we are definitely seeing a lot of interest and demand there. I do think COVID is really accelerating the future of work. And many of the trends there are -- will last through time. I think it gives all of us a chance to reimagine this -- reimagine what does collaboration and productivity at scale, including people working remotely, looks like. And we plan to be at the forefront of it, and so I'm excited for the opportunity there.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler\nfrom Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler (Barclays): Hi. Just two questions. If we look at Search, your growth rates in January and February compared to today, so pre-COVID versus today, I guess how many categories are above the Jan/Feb growth rate? Is travel the only large category at this stage that's running below, your pre-COVID growth rates in Search? And then the second question is on the topic of the Apple-Search agreement. So as you guys said in your blog post, based on other agreements where you've seen things change hands, you didn't really lose a lot of query volume after the change. So what do you think the recapture rate of queries on Safari toolbar would be if that deal were to change hands? Is this really a code red situation or is it something that we should be able to manage through? Thanks a lot.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of your first question, as we've often said, we have a very diverse business globally; and that's across sectors, customer size, geographies. And with respect to sectors, we saw broad-based improvement across virtually all. It basically mirrors what you see in the broader economy, and we don't break out more than that. But it was quite broad-based. In terms of your second question, Sundar, do you want to take that?\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On Search, as I've said for a long time, we work hard to make sure users can conveniently access us. Most of our partners choose us because\n\n we are the best search provider. Users find us having the highest search quality, and so there's organic demand for it. And we believe in investing in our experience across all our platforms. And so we are definitely committed to making sure we can serve our users everywhere, and we are really focused on it.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We know you all have a busy evening. We look forward to speaking with you again in our fourth quarter 2020 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\nCandice (Operator): Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you will need to press star, one on your touch tone telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star, zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Additional information will also be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2020. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. 2020 was a year unlike any other. We are proud that people continue to choose Google\u2019s products to stay informed, connected and comforted during uncertain times. Being helpful to people in moments big and small is the foundation of everything we do. The past year also accelerated the shift to cloud, and adoption of online services. This has profound implications for all companies and consumers, and we\u2019re pleased that so many trust us to help them make this transition. In particular, Google\u2019s products and support have been a lifeline for millions of small and medium businesses hit hard by the pandemic.\nToday I\u2019ll review some of the important work we\u2019ve done this quarter across Google and Alphabet, with a particular focus on our growing Cloud business, which we are breaking out as a separate segment for the first time. Then I\u2019ll welcome to the call Google\u2019s Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, who many of you know from investor conferences and events. Philipp will speak about partnerships, business and advertising trends in the Google Services segment. We\u2019ve heard you\u2019d appreciate more texture and detail here. Then Ruth will go through the quarter in more detail.\nFirst, some highlights at Google. Since the pandemic began, our teams have built new features and products to help people and businesses. Now we are helping with the complex challenge of getting vaccines to billions of people around the world. Vaccination locations have started to roll\n\n out in Google Search and Maps. Google Cloud\u2019s Intelligent Vaccine Impact Platform is helping authorities improve vaccine distribution and forecasting. We\u2019re providing substantial new ad grants to the CDC, the World Health Organization and others to promote vaccine education. We\u2019re also making direct grants to organizations addressing racial and geographic disparities in vaccination access, plus opening up Google\u2019s facilities as vaccination clinics as needed.\nElsewhere. In Maps, we added a new community feed in the Explore tab. And now you can track takeout and delivery orders when you book or order from Google Maps. At YouTube,\nwe\u2019re building products to help creators benefit from two important trends: live video and short-form video. More than half a million channels live streamed on YouTube for the first time in 2020, from artists performing in their living rooms to churches moving their services online. And videos in our new Shorts player are receiving 3.5 billion daily views. We\u2019re looking forward to expanding Shorts to more countries this year.\nPhilipp will dive into the work to support online commerce and our partners, but I want to call out our News Showcase product. It\u2019s a $1 billion dollar investment in partnerships with news publishers, and I\u2019m really excited about our progress here. We\u2019ve now signed agreements with nearly 450 publications - the majority of which are local and regional - across a dozen countries including France, Germany, UK, and Brazil. And last month we announced a new global deal with Reuters, as well as an agreement with one of the major French publishing associations, to open access to News Showcase. We want to do more partnerships, in more countries, and will have more to announce in the weeks to come.\nAmong other highlights, we also launched our reimagined Google Pay app, making it easier to organize finances and save money. It\u2019s now used by over 150 million people in 30 countries. In hardware, we recently closed our acquisition of Fitbit which will improve our product pipeline, and help make health and wellness accessible to more people. To all the Fitbit employees - welcome to Google! We have a great portfolio of products and I look forward to sharing more about our product plans.\nNow, a closer look at Google Cloud. I am very pleased with the progress here, and as Ruth will mention, we will continue making disciplined investments to scale the business and improve profitability. Google Cloud delivered revenue growth of 47% year-over-year \u2013 with GCP growth remaining meaningfully above the growth rate for Cloud overall. In addition, our backlog grew to nearly $30 billion \u2013 up from $19 billion in Q3 \u2013 nearly all attributable to Cloud. We continue to invest strongly in the business given the momentum we are seeing. These investments in our go-to-market organization have helped us win larger deals, including several billion dollar deals in 2020. Deals over $250 million more than tripled in the same period.\nWe are also seeing strong growth through our broad network of partners, with our channel partner ecosystem growing more than five times and indirect channel revenue more than doubling in the past two years. Our industry leading customer satisfaction, as identified in a recent report from IDC, is helping us drive significant expansion and net revenue retention with existing customers. Our products are mature and highly differentiated in many segments.\nIn Infrastructure Cloud, our leadership in multi-cloud and cybersecurity helped us win large data center and IT transformation deals with customers like Highmark Health and Vodafone, as well as Cloud Native leaders including Wayfair and Etsy. Our leading Data and Analytics Cloud\n\n provides new customers such as Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine in healthcare, and Mercado Libre in retail, with the ability to analyze any data in real time across any cloud.\nOur industry solutions, based on our AI/ML expertise, have helped us win customers like Optus in Communications, and OTTO Group in retail. I am also particularly excited to see us winning large transformations by bringing the entire breadth of Google\u2019s technology to customers. Yesterday we announced our multi-year partnership with Ford, which is using Google Cloud, Android, and other Google apps and services to transform their business.\nGoogle Workspace, the industry\u2019s only Cloud native communication and collaboration solution, is helping companies meet their evolving hybrid workplace needs. Workspace is driving innovation at many of the fastest growing companies. Additionally, this quarter we expanded our partnership with SAP. They will extend their usage of Google Cloud for their cloud solutions, including SAP Business Technology Platform, to provide the best experience for our joint customers.\nAcross the Alphabet portfolio, our investments in AI continue to drive progress. For example, DeepMind's AI-powered protein folding breakthrough will enable researchers to tackle new and difficult problems, from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability. Google\u2019s partnership with Mayo Clinic is developing AI systems that can help plan radiotherapy treatment. Waymo is now providing hundreds of fully autonomous rides per week, and recently partnered with Daimler Trucks to develop fully autonomous trucks.\nTo wrap up, last year I talked about our four big themes of helpfulness, trust, execution, and sustainable value. These will continue to guide our strategic focus across the company in 2021 and beyond, as we continue to advance our core information mission in products like Search, Maps and YouTube, keep people\u2019s information safe and secure, drive substantial advancements in AI over the next three years, and ensure we\u2019re the most effective place to work beyond COVID, all supported by sustainable long-term businesses.\nI want to thank our teams across Google and Alphabet for all of their work this quarter and throughout all of 2020. 2021 gives us another chance to be helpful to people, businesses, and communities. While there is hard work ahead, I am profoundly optimistic about what we\u2019ll accomplish together. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Philipp.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar and good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s great to be joining you today. We are pleased with Google Services revenues of $52.9 billion in the fourth quarter, which continued the significant rebound from the negative impact of COVID earlier in the year. Two trends drove the strong results across Search, YouTube and Network advertising. Consumers continued to move more of their activity online and advertisers responded to this shift in consumer behavior by reactivating spend that they had paused earlier in the crisis. In the fourth quarter, retail was the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our Ads business. Tech, media and entertainment, and CPG were also strong contributors.\nThe trajectory of search advertising over the past year demonstrates its responsiveness to consumer interests and needs, and how marketers can quickly adjust their spending as circumstances change to focus on generating ROI for their businesses. In YouTube, direct response had substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire year, including the fourth\n\n quarter. After a substantial pullback at the outset of the pandemic, brand spending began to recover in the third quarter. Marketers realized that even if there was a pullback in consumer demand in the short-term, they needed to keep their brands in front of people to stay top-of-mind when spending picked back up. In the fourth quarter, we saw significant acceleration of brand spending on YouTube. Network revenues in the fourth quarter benefited from the same uplift in spend by advertisers, particularly in AdMob and Ad Manager. Google Other Revenues were driven by growth in YouTube\u2019s non-advertising revenues, primarily from subscriptions, as well as by Google Play revenue growth.\nI now want to step back from the results of the quarter and quickly reflect on the generational shift to digital we\u2019ve seen over the past year and what that means for our business. First, dramatic changes to consumer behavior have fundamentally changed the way companies are doing business across many industries and geographies. Lufthansa, or in German, Lufthansa, is a great example. Like many airlines, they needed more insight on where to fly, at what capacity and how often as travel started to open up last year. Over the summer, we built a product called Flight Demand Explorer which gave real-time answers to these questions, helping them find demand and ramp up. Within two months, they tripled destination routes and got more than 80 planes back in the air - with many flights fully sold out within days.\nWe\u2019re putting real-time insights into the hands of businesses in other verticals. In fact, we just launched a new Insights Page to give our advertisers the latest on ever-changing search trends relevant to their business, right inside of Google Ads. Petco is another great example - as people adopted an unprecedented number of pets during shelter-in-place, it led to a spike in demand for pet supplies, and Petco saw their curbside pickup services go through the roof. So they accelerated delivery and pickup options using Search, Shopping and Local inventory ads and were able to drive a 100% increase in their ecommerce business.\nAnd, this is important. Multi-touch points \u2013 like curbside pickup and pickup in store \u2013 are in high demand and here to stay. We've seen huge year-on-year jumps in searches for \"available near me\" and \u201ccurbside pickup.\u201d Retailers offering multi-touch are benefiting from this trend and this offering sits squarely in our core capabilities with Maps and Search. Let me tell you about L\u2019Oreal. They did a great job adapting to changes in shopping behavior by making a sharp pivot to ecommerce and to TrueView. By making existing video creatives more timely and actionable, their Kiehl's US brand drove record visits to their site from YouTube - 4x more per dollar. They\u2019re also partnering with us to bring AR experiences for their cosmetics across Google surfaces including YouTube and Search. I could go on and on. Companies are rapidly adapting.\nNext, I\u2019d like to talk about how we are evolving our commerce strategy. We\u2019ve taken significant steps to accelerate an open ecosystem for online retail that benefits businesses of all sizes, from large online household names to your neighborhood store just around the corner. We\u2019ve long said that we want to make Google the best place for users to start their shopping journeys, regardless of where those journeys end. In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth rate in retail searches was more than 3 times the rate we had seen in the same period last year, driven in part by COVID.\nWe also want to make Google the best place for merchants to connect with users, regardless of whether the transaction happens on our platform or theirs. Over the last 12 months, we grew our merchant community over 80%, with significant growth in small and medium-sized\n\n businesses. All of these merchants and their inventory will show up across Google, including Search, Image Search and YouTube.\nI want to close by talking about something that has been a principle of Google\u2019s since our founding. We\u2019ve always believed that the future of Google and the future of our partners are fundamentally linked. In fact, we built our business on revenue share models that support a broad range of partners, including large and small online publishers; individual YouTube creators broadcasting from their homes and global music labels; as well as Google Play developers of all sizes. We only succeed when our customers and partners succeed.\nOne number I think is worthwhile highlighting in this context. Over the past three years, we paid out nearly $140 billion to our partners \u2013 from Google Play developers and publisher partners using our advertising services, to YouTube creators, artists and media organizations around the world. Our performance is only possible because of our customers and partners. I want to thank them for their partnership, collaboration and feedback. I also want to thank our product, partnership, sales and many support teams for their tremendous work, innovating to help our users, customers and partners succeed, especially through these difficult times. I\u2019ll now hand off the call to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter performance, after an unprecedented year. For 2020, Total Alphabet Revenues were $183 billion, up 13% year-on-year, or up 14% in constant currency. With our new segment disclosures this quarter, I\u2019ll start with quarterly results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. My focus will be on year-on-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise.\nFor the fourth quarter, our Consolidated Revenues were $56.9 billion, up 23%, which reflect broad-based increases in advertiser spending in Search and YouTube within Google Services, as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our Total Cost of Revenues was $26.1 billion, up 24%, primarily driven by Other Cost of Revenues which was $15.6 billion, and up 25%. The biggest factors here were, first - content acquisition costs - primarily driven by costs for YouTube\u2019s advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content; and second - costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation.\nOperating expenses were $15.2 billion, down 4%. The year-on-year decline reflects the lapping of valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily in R&D, as well as the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID. Each of the three components of opex also reflects our decision to slow headcount growth beginning late in the first quarter. Headcount was up 3,180 from the third quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers, with continued aggressive investment in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.\nOperating Income was $15.7 billion, up 69% and our operating margin in the quarter was 28%. Other Income & Expense was $3.0 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net Income was $15.2 billion. Operating Cash Flow was $22.7 billion, with Free Cash Flow of $17.2 billion in the quarter and $43 billion for the full year 2020. We ended the fourth quarter with $137 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results.\n\n Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services Revenues were $52.9 billion, up 22%. Each component of our advertising revenues reflects the return of advertiser spend in response to the continued movement of consumer activity online that Philipp spoke about, including Google search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter, up 17%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion, up 46%, driven by a rebound not only in brand advertising, but also ongoing strength in direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion, up 23%.\nOther Revenues were $6.7 billion, up 27%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising and Play revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the fourth quarter continued to benefit from elevated levels of engagement, reflecting increases in active buyers and spend per buyer due to COVID; however, we did experience a deceleration in growth from the levels we saw in the third quarter. Google Services operating income was $19.1 billion, up 41%, and the operating margin was 36%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace. Revenues were $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, up 47%. GCP\u2019s revenue growth rate was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus last year.\nAs to our Other Bets, for the full year 2020, revenues were $657 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily, and reflect that most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue. The operating loss was $4.5 billion for the full year 2020 versus an operating loss of $4.8 billion in 2019.\nLet me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google Services, we\u2019re encouraged by the increase in consumer online activity and the return of advertiser spend, as reflected in our Q4 results. Looking forward to 2021, year-over-year quarterly comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year \u2013 with easier comps in the first half, especially in Q2, and then lapping stronger performance in the second half. With respect to Other Revenues, with the closing of the Fitbit acquisition earlier this [sic] [last] month, we will be reporting its revenues within Google Other.\nIn terms of investment levels within Google Services, late in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of COVID, we made what we described as \u2018tactical\u2019 adjustments to slow the pace of spend in certain categories. Given the ongoing uncertainty in the external environment, we maintained the discipline through the rest of 2020. Looking forward, we do expect the pace of investment to increase to support the extraordinary opportunities we see given the usefulness of our products and services in this environment. The investment pace will ramp up over the course of the year.\nAs for Google Cloud, we\u2019ve obviously been investing aggressively, given the substantial market opportunity we see. Under Thomas Kurian\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ve further accelerated investment to strengthen the position of the business. For example, we are on track to meet our near-term goal of tripling the size of the Cloud direct sales force and have greatly expanded the partner channel. We\u2019ve also substantially improved our product offering, while rationalizing our approach to focus on our six key industry verticals. And we\u2019ve invested in\n\n expanding our network of locations for compute capacity to support Cloud, ending 2020 serving customers in 24 regions and 73 zones.\nWe\u2019re encouraged by the momentum in the growth of revenue and customer wins. We more than doubled revenues over the last two years, from $5.8 billion in 2018 to $13.1 billion in 2020. Our backlog, which is nearly all attributable to Cloud, nearly tripled from 2019 to 2020. Although increases in backlog do not directly correlate to revenue trends, the growth in backlog demonstrates the success Google Cloud is having with large enterprises which are signing meaningful long-term commitment agreements.\nLooking forward, we will continue to focus on revenue growth driven by ongoing investment in products and the go-to-market organization. Cloud\u2019s operating loss reflects that we have meaningfully built out our organization ahead of revenues, as we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, with respect to the substantial investments in our go-to-market organization as well as engineering and technical infrastructure. Operating loss and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time. In addition, we are focused on delivering on efficiency efforts across the board to contribute incrementally to profitability over time. Finally, as you can see from the historical data provided in the press release, Cloud\u2019s operating loss was higher in the first quarter relative to other quarters and then the operating loss improves thereafter. We expect similar seasonality in 2021.\nIn terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity. On headcount, we plan to reaccelerate the pace of hiring in Google Services in line with our opportunities. Our headcount growth will also reflect the addition of Fitbit and our ongoing transition of certain customer support roles from third party vendors to Google\u2019s in-house operations centers. We also plan to continue to prioritize investment in both sales and technical roles for Google Cloud.\nTurning to CapEx at the consolidated level, the year-on-year results this quarter again reflect the slower pace throughout 2020 of investment in office facilities. Within technical infrastructure, servers continued to be the largest driver of investment in the fourth quarter, followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we expect a return to a more normalized pace of ground up construction and fitout of office facilities which translates into a sizable increase in CapEx in 2021. Servers will continue to be the largest driver of spend on technical infrastructure.\nFinally, a housekeeping point. As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for assets as of year-end 2020. We look forward to the year ahead. Hope everyone stays safe. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star, then one on your touch tone telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. And our question first comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you so much for taking the question. And I hope everyone is safe 7\n\n and well on the team there, as well. Maybe I'll try first on Cloud. I don't know if it's better to Sundar or to Ruth. But can you just conceptually help us understand how to think about the opportunity you\u2019re skating after versus Cloud and how it factors back into what you want to invest against the opportunity or possibly, maybe even accelerate the opportunity by looking at inorganic paths to growing scale vis-\u00e0-vis competition in the space. And then maybe for Philipp, if I can. YouTube continues to evolve as a platform; there's now subscription offerings, you highlighted the strength you're seeing in DR. Can you talk a little bit about the path for monetization in the coming years and how we should think about the opportunity against the large-scaled audience and engagement you see at YouTube broadly? Thank you so much.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On Cloud, obviously we see how early customers are in this shift. We see the large TAM ahead and definitely the market dynamics. And our momentum in the context of the market is what is the framework with which we are thinking about \u2013 the scale of investments and the pace of investments. Obviously, it's an area in which, the longer you are in \u2013 the cohorts add up and so contributes more and the economies of scale starts working as well. But we are definitely investing ahead to make \u2013 making sure we are able to serve the customers globally across all the offerings they're interested in. And that's how we are thinking about it. Ruth, not sure you want to add more?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: I think that's the main point, just given the sheer scale of the opportunity and our position investing to really position ourselves well across industries and geographies. And the key elements of it I tried to call out in opening comments, investing in product, go-to-market, data centers. And you can see it in the results. I think you are going to continue to see us building there, and that's what we're talking about building ahead. We are keenly focused on delivering for both customers and shareholders. And that, of course, includes an intense focus on the path to profitability.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes, and on your question on YouTube, on the overall development and the subscription side. Our direct response business on YouTube was practically nonexistent three years ago, and now it's one of our largest and fastest-growing ad offerings on YouTube. And with TrueView for Action, we're actually making it easier for advertisers to unlock opportunities to reach audiences with video campaigns. And just to give you a few numbers, 60% of TrueView for Action customers are new to YouTube. And we more than doubled the number of active advertisers using TrueView for Action in the first six months of 2020.\nAnd we're really tapping into the tremendous innate commercial behavior on the platform. 70% of YouTube viewers are saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube. I talked about L\u2019Oreal earlier \u2013 MasterClass is another great example. Online learning has become a huge opportunity, and they use TrueView for Action to connect the right people to the right content. And so, really big \u2013 like 140% increase in clicks to their sites, 70% increase in signups to courses, and so on. YouTube continues, in our view, to be amazing for brand advertisers as well. Our brand business was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic \u2013 rebounded in Q3 and into Q4. And it really helps advertisers reach younger audiences they can't reach anywhere. We now reach more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined, watch time is increasing, advertiser effectiveness is getting better and better and so this is very nice development.\n\n On the subscription strategy, maybe just briefly, Music is an incredibly popular vertical on YouTube and, obviously, a key part of the overall experience. We found that users wanted a premium YouTube experience and, basically the ability to download songs and videos. YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams, of course, for music labels and publishers as well. In 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. We have over 30 million Music and Premium paid subscribers. We are now operating over 95 countries. So members get a lot of extra benefits.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Ruth and Sundar, I just wanted to follow up on Eric's question a bit. Anything else you can add just in terms of the significant inflection that you saw on Google Cloud backlog there? And, I guess, in particular, curious in what you're seeing in terms of benefit and success as you're leveraging Alphabet more broadly, like in the Ford deal? And then how do you think about Google Cloud margins structurally kind of long-term relative to peers? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Maybe I'll start with the \u2013 customers are looking for digital transformation. And depending on the sector they are in, they're definitely interested in a broader solution set across the breadth of what Google and Alphabet can bring. We see this in healthcare, our efforts in Google Health \u2013 work that's happening in Verily all end up helping. Ford is great example of \u2013 as they are thinking longer term, not just for Cloud but Android auto-powering their vehicles. And so these are big transformations cutting across the company. And one of the areas where we are really executing is leveraging our global business operations that Philipp runs in partnering closely with Thomas's teams. And that definitely brings in a lot of synergies here.\nOn your second question, on the broader stuff, the one thing I would say is \u2013 and I mentioned in part earlier, we get into these long-term deals, and so over time, as you add more cohorts, that contributes to the margin structure. It is \u2013 the scale of the product offerings, the number of areas and the number of regions in the world, there's a much more significant investment. And so there's definitely a fixed cost structure associated with it. And we are also investing ahead. But as we scale up the business, we expect the trends to be favorable.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Good afternoon. Yes, you mentioned you accelerated \u2013 saw accelerating brand spend in the quarter, and many investors are asking the sustainability in what you're seeing in that as you head into the beginning of this year. If you could just talk directionally in terms of how your clients are acting as they head out of the holiday season, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Sure. I'll take that. As we've each noted, the financial results really did reflect this increase in advertiser activity. And that was in part unlocking\n\n budgets that they had paused earlier in the year, as well as really reflecting the increase in consumer online activity. The largest contributor, as Philipp mentioned, was retail, the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of the Ads business, though I would say tech, media, and entertainment, as well as CPG, were also meaningful contributors.\nAnd for Search, we saw ongoing improvement in advertiser spend broadly. For YouTube, direct response, as Philipp talked about, really did maintain a very high level of growth and the acceleration in overall YouTube revenue growth reflects a pickup in brand advertising across all verticals on top of the ongoing strength that we saw in DR. And then in Network, also, same point \u2013 it's this pickup in advertiser spend \u2013 as Philipp noted, it was led by growth in AdMob and Ad Manager.\nSo we are really pleased with Q4. It was a great end to a challenging year. And when we think about 2021, I made the point in opening comments, we obviously have easier year-on-year comparisons in the first half as we anniversary the effects of the pandemic. So not much more to add. It was a strong quarter, and we feel really good about the level of activity.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks, Ruth.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman\nSachs. Your line is now open.\nHeath Terry (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate the level of detail on the drivers behind the acceleration in Search and YouTube. I was wondering if you could go a bit further and disaggregate or give even just qualitatively the drivers behind that acceleration between pre-pandemic advertisers returning to prior spending levels versus new advertisers or new advertiser spend being allocated to the platform?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Well, I think the main point is sort of this mega comment that we saw a slowdown. And as Philipp said, and we talked about on prior calls, one of the first things that happens is a step back, and then you see as users re-engage and activity picks up and the effectiveness of advertising, the ROI available, you see advertising come back in. I remember talking about this throughout last year, that we had seen this, actually, going back to the prior financial crisis. And what you've seen is just a broad-based re-engagement, which we're really pleased about across industries. And it's also, as Philipp noted in his comments, there's been a tremendous opportunity really to step in here and help small, medium-businesses as they were evolving and adapting to this new digital world, and it's been quite key there as well.\nHeath Terry (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you very much.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan\nStanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Philipp. Philipp, the first one, I appreciate all the color on retail and commerce, the merchant community growing so strong in the last year. I'd be curious to hear about your discussions now with merchants and sort of what the largest friction points that they're looking for you to solve and\n\n sort of continue to help them as the world reopens \u2013 kind of the merchant discussions. And then secondly, a question on one of the earlier products, on Discover Feed. Love to hear about sort of early learnings on Discover Feed and how you think about hurdles you need to overcome to monetize that.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thank you very much for the question. Look, at the highest level, we want to build a healthier ecommerce ecosystem. When people come to Google to shop, we want them to help find the best products or the best prices from really the widest range of merchants, and we want our results to be as comprehensive and relevant as possible. And we took some significant steps last year, as you know, on Google Shopping. And in many ways, we really see them as a return to first principles here \u2013 free listings, zero commissions, really good feedback helps lower barriers for online retail. So we've become a great place for stores to connect with potential customers, whether it's by driving traffic to the websites, for free listings or ads, or just by making it easier for purchases to happen directly on Google. And by the way, let me be clear, also Shopping Ads will continue to be a powerful way for retailers to promote their products, obviously.\nSo, overall, we're providing an open ecosystem that works for every kind of business, from national chains and online marketplaces to just your small local stores. And we're giving retailers more choice, which is very well-received, by opening our platform to third-party providers \u2013 we talked about this starting with PayPal and Shopify. And we brought YouTube into the fold, and we've begun experimenting with a feature that lets you learn a lot more about products in videos on a limited set of channels and so on and so on. So I would say, overall, it's very, very well-received.\nOn the Discover side, Discover has grown \u2013 so Discover is Discover and, obviously, Discovery Ads. So Discover has grown dramatically since we launched it, I think, just three years ago. People are loving how we're surfacing relevant information, gorgeous visuals, all in what we call queryless feed experience. And, naturally, some of these experiences are commercial. And we made Discovery Ads generally available about six months ago \u2013 I think it was May 2020. And it's already reaching up to 3 billion people across Discover, YouTube, Gmail, and that's worldwide. And advertisers love how we're able to drive performance objectives by really matching their premium creatives with Google intent on our \u2013 what we call queryless surfaces.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great, thanks.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from\nBaird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Maybe for Sundar or Philipp, a follow-up on YouTube. Just given the strength of those services, ads and subscriptions, during the pandemic, I wonder if part of what we're seeing is more of an acceleration from TV ad budgets from linear spending to more of YouTube spending. I mean, given also the momentum we've seen in over-the-top over the last nine months or so. And then given some of the changing industry dynamics around privacy, including what you've already announced around browser cookies, wondering what plans might be as well for Android and how I should think about the potential impact on ad revenues broadly as a result of privacy changes? Thank you.\n\n Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yeah, I can take that. We've seen brands steadily shift budgets to YouTube to complement their linear TV buys as TV audiences really become more fragmented. And as traditional TV ratings continue to decline, TV advertisers are turning to streaming platforms like YouTube to reach people who are no longer watching TV. Connected TVs are our fastest growing screen. In the U.S., we have over 100 million people that watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month. YouTube helps advertisers reach younger audiences they can't reach anywhere else. We talked about it \u2013 YouTube reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined.\nAnd so there is an opportunity \u2013 big opportunity \u2013 for YouTube to help brands and agencies really more easily connect with this audience, and we're very invested in this space. And just to give you a few examples, in the second half of last year, we launched a YouTube masthead on TV screens to help advertisers drive awareness with large audiences in, basically, a single moment. Many are taking advantage of it \u2013 Uber, many others. We launched Brand Lift for YouTube on TV screens to really help advertisers make informed decisions about ad performance, optimize streaming campaigns in real time, and so on. And we also made it possible last year for advertisers to basically buy among the most popular YouTube and YouTube TV content viewed on the TV screens. And one, will be called one singular lineup.\nQuickly, on the third-party cookie strategy, in general, we know that expectations are really changing for how data is used online. And people are demanding greater privacy. We're taking our responsibility to user privacy and to supporting our partners in the web ecosystem very, very seriously. In 2019, we announced the Privacy Sandbox, which is an open standards initiative to invent new technology that will replace third-party cookies with a set of privacy-preserving mechanisms for the web. And we're making great progress.\nWe shared a detailed proposal with the industry for experimentation and feedback. We shared recently as well our \u2013 what we call, FLOC \u2013 our Federated Learning of Cohorts API, which we think provides an effective replacement signal for third-party cookies. And we really believe Privacy Sandbox is the best path forward, and we remain very committed to our collaboration with the ads community on privacy-preserving open standard mechanisms that can, what we call, sustain a healthy and ad-supported web.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thanks, Philipp.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from\nMoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks. Philipp, I was following up on Colin's question just perfectly. I wanted to understand frameworks because if you think about the bigger opportunity longer term and prioritize \u2013 priorities in streaming video, right? So are you happy with the progress of YouTube TV so far? Will you expand into other countries? And could you contrast that with the opportunity you see in [indiscernible] TVs and devices as you have done for Google TV or Chromecast? And then is there a perceived added value from advertisers for this type of inventory? Does it attract a new type of advertiser to offer YouTube TV inventory or Connected TV inventory from traditional YouTube advertising?\n\n Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Maybe I'll comment on \u2013 one of the things which has worked well for Google over the years is we really try to reach users where they are. And that's how Google has worked always. We've invested across platforms, across devices, across countries. And I think the same applies for the YouTube experience. We want to bring it to the screen that's most convenient for users. And, hence, our investment in Google TV,\nChromecast, YouTube TV as a whole itself.\nAnd I think \u2013 we are taking a long-term view here, obviously focused on the user experience and really getting it all to work well. We know while smartphones are at the center, for YouTube, TV is an important form factor. And over time, people will use it across multiple screens. And so that's the experience we are focused on. And anytime we create that experience, we know over time there is value to be captured commercially as well that makes sense for advertisers. But we take a long-term view.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: And I talked about the Connected TV part already. Maybe briefly just on YouTube TV. YouTube TV continues to gain momentum. Our advertising efforts on YouTube TV itself are still very, very early. But we think there is an opportunity to apply some of our targeting and measurement capabilities to really provide a better user and advertiser experience over time. And, yes, we heard from customers. They have a very strong interest in advertising and streaming environments. I mentioned how we combine it in the single lineups. So that's an interesting path going forward.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit\nSuisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Okay. Thank you so much. So, Sundar, I think let's \u2013 I think you recently talked about a 10-to-20-year journey for AI and quantum computing to unlock new use cases. I think you've brought up in the past some of the ways AI is helping you with the products that you have in market right now. But as we take a more longer-term look into the future, what do you think some of the new applications could be? And I think, Philipp, it might have been a few years ago when you were speaking at an investor conference and you called out the desire to onboard and help SMBs, particularly as they really had no way to advertise before. And Google and online in general presented a golden opportunity to really help them grow their business. So where do you think you are in terms of putting together an easy-to-use set of tools to help those who otherwise don't really have agency representation, so that they can reach all the different customers that they should be reaching across all the diverse services that you're offering? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Stephen. And I'll answer the AI part first. We've always wanted to be foundational in how we approach technological advances. That's the core competency we invest in across the company. We're one of the largest R&D investors in the world and, obviously, AI is a big part of it. Just I'm really excited that we \u2013 over the past few years, while we have made progress in understanding different modalities, be it text, images, voice, vision, et cetera, there is \u2013 we definitely \u2013 I think we are at an inflection point. And we are investing to build better models and deepen our understanding and do it in a more generalized way. And when we do that, it will apply horizontally across our products.\n\n You saw a version of that when we shipped BERT in Search, and it was one of our biggest quality improvements. But you'll see that flow across be it Google Search, YouTube, Android, as well as our investments in Alphabet, be it self-driving cars or robotics. So we take that view and definitely want to make sure we are driving state-of-the-art progress. Philipp?\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes. So first, let me recognize \u2013 I mean, it has obviously been a very, very challenging environment for SMBs: many weren't online, many lost line of sight to demand overnight due to COVID. So around this time last year, as soon as we saw the scale of the impact, we really accelerated products that give our customers, and especially our SMB customers, signals to help them actually navigate and pivot.\nAnd as I noted earlier, as more consumers moved online and advertisers obviously responded by reactivating spend, we also saw our advertiser base grow, particularly the number of smaller advertisers or SMBs. We're helping them see shifts in supply and demand, not just across sectors but actually within sectors. For example, travel continues to get hit hard, pretty hard. And after the initial lockdown last year, searches for vacation homes and B&B rentals saw huge spikes. And that continues to fluctuate.\nOn the other hand, look at retail \u2013 demand isn't disappearing, it's shifting in many cases. We're seeing increases in searches for things like gym equipment, crafts, patio heaters, and so on, anything related to outdoor activity and so on. We're obviously thinking about how to help SMBs on products like Maps. Like, over the last five years, we've made more than a thousand improvements to business profiles, making it a lot easier for merchants to connect with customers. And especially now in the crisis, in 2020, we added new features to, for example, provide COVID updates, service changes, and new attributes like takeout, delivery, curbside pickup, now all easily available for consumers on Maps to connect them to their favorite SMBs. So really incredible investment, frankly, from our side, and I think it's very well received.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2021 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.", "20211": "This transcript is provided for the convenience of investors only, for a full recording please see the Q1 2021 Earnings Call webcast.\nAlphabet Q1 2021 Earnings Call April 27, 2021\nCandice (Operator): Welcome everyone and thank you for standing by for the Alphabet first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. After a hard year, people in some parts of the world are beginning to rebuild their lives, businesses, and communities. But recovery is far from uniform across the globe as the tragic scenes in countries like India and Brazil remind us.\nWe\u2019re continuing to help support public health officials in their vital and urgent work. Our focus is on providing authoritative information. We\u2019re helping over 100 government agencies and non-profits worldwide distribute critical information, and billions of PSAs, about COVID-19 and vaccines. And Google Cloud technology is powering a virtual agent to help make vaccination appointments over the phone \u2013 supporting 28 languages and dialects \u2013 for those with limited internet access. We are focused on doing our part to help.\nIn some parts of the world, the economy began to rebound, which created a rising tide in the first quarter that benefited a number of sectors, including existing and emerging companies and partners. For example, data suggest that investment in startups is at an all time high. Our product releases are returning to a regular cadence. I\u2019m particularly excited that our developer event, Google I/O, is back this year, all-virtual and free for everyone, on May 18th through 20th. We\u2019ll have significant product updates and announcements, and I invite you all to tune in.\nToday, I\u2019ll briefly mention a few highlights from the past quarter, and go a bit deeper on Cloud. Then, Philipp will discuss advertising and partnership developments. Finally, Ruth will cover the quarterly results. Quickly turning to product highlights of the quarter. Our knowledge and\n\n information services like Search and Maps remain at the heart of our mission to provide helpful and accurate information during important moments. People have turned to Google Search more than ever since the pandemic began. We see hundreds of millions of searches every day for COVID and related health information.\nPeople are also searching for jobs. To help them, job seekers can now use Search to quickly and easily find roles that do not require a college degree, and we\u2019re working together with the top employment websites to make the service even better. Maps will be adding over 100 AI-powered improvements this year, such as Indoor Live View, which helps you navigate airports, transit stations and malls using augmented reality. Last quarter I mentioned Google News Showcase, our $1 billion investment in the news industry. I\u2019m pleased to see continued momentum this quarter, with new launches in the UK, Italy, Argentina, and Australia. In Q1, we added more than 170 publications across 12 countries, with more coming soon.\nWith respect to YouTube, people continue to find all types of informational content, from educational videos to podcasts. In fact, according to a recent study conducted by Ipsos, 77% of respondents say they used YouTube during 2020 to learn a new skill. YouTube Shorts continues to gain popularity, with over 6.5 billion daily views as of March, up from 3.5 billion at the end of 2020. We\u2019ve added a new metric to our transparency reports, called the Violative View Rate, which will help us estimate what percentage of views on YouTube come from content that violates our policies. In Q4 of last year, YouTube\u2019s violative view rate was between 16 and 18 views out of every 10,000. This is down over 70% compared to the same quarter in 2017, in large part thanks to our investments in machine learning.\nLet me also mention Chrome OS, which this quarter celebrated 10 years. It\u2019s been a valuable tool for millions of students and teachers during the pandemic. According to third parties, Chromebooks were the most popular device in K-12 education globally for the last year.\nNext, I\u2019ll move to Cloud, where we continue to see strong performance across both Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. Q1 revenue grew 46% year-over-year, with GCP\u2019s revenue growth rate once again meaningfully above Cloud overall. We continue to unlock the value of the Google ecosystem by signing multi-year, multi-product partnerships with companies like Global Payments and Grupo Globo. And just yesterday we announced a new Google-wide partnership with Univision, which is migrating to our Cloud, continuing to distribute content on YouTube, and reaching customers via Play and Ads.\nIn Cloud, there are three distinct market trends shaping our growth and driving our product and go-to-market strategy. First, we see very strong customer momentum in the Data Cloud. Our expertise in real-time data and analytics is winning companies like Twitter and Ingersoll Rand, who are moving their complex data workloads to Google Cloud. Our strength in AI and ML is also helping Financial Services customers like HSBC, Commerzbank, SEB Group and BBVA improve efficiency of payments, reduce fraud and risk, and deliver faster payment solutions. This past quarter, we released new functionality for BigQuery, delivering significantly better performance for Business Intelligence queries.\nSecond, we\u2019re seeing customers wanting a robust Infrastructure Cloud in order to create operational efficiencies and reduce IT costs. We are winning large IT transformation deals with companies that are migrating their data centers to Google Cloud. Multi-cloud remains a\n\n differentiator as it provides the easiest and most open development environment for customers like Telus, allowing them to access and move their data between various clouds.\nThird, we continue to deliver helpful innovations to enable hybrid work with Google Workspace. This includes digital tools for front line workers like nurses and retail store workers, as well as new security offerings. These innovations have helped grow our revenue per seat and the number of seats in the last quarter. Workspace is being adopted by customers including Keralty in Healthcare, Sun Life in Financial Services, and Airbus in Manufacturing & Aviation.\nNow, a brief update on Other Bets. Waymo\u2019s fully autonomous public ride-hailing service in Phoenix is providing hundreds of rides per week. In San Francisco, Waymo has begun limited employee testing. I am pleased by the progress here, and look forward to Waymo\u2019s continued momentum under the leadership of new co-CEOs Tekedra and Dmitri. Calico and its partner, AbbVie, announced that it has entered clinical-stage programs for new drug therapies for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, like ALS, Parkinson\u2019s disease and traumatic brain injury.\nBefore I close, I want to mention that in 2021, in the U.S. alone, we plan to invest over $7 billion in offices and data centers, and create at least 10,000 new full-time jobs. And as we do this, we continue to make progress on our sustainability goals. We\u2019ve matched our operations with 100% renewable energy for the past four years, and we are working towards operating on carbon-free energy, around the clock, by 2030 \u2013 a far more ambitious goal that we hope will be transformative for the industry.\nFive of our data centers in Europe and North America are already operating near or at 90% carbon-free energy, around the clock. We\u2019re also working towards our commitment to help one billion people make more sustainable choices with our services by 2022. One example of how we\u2019re doing this is a new AI-powered feature in Maps that will show the route with the lowest carbon footprint when ETAs are the same. You\u2019ll also be able to compare the carbon impact between routes.\nFinally, as we look ahead to the rest of 2021, our four big themes continue to guide us. First, building and providing the most helpful products and services. Second, continuing to earn the trust of our users, by investing in high quality information and keeping users\u2019 data safe and private. Third, strong execution as a company, particularly as we start to re-open our offices. And fourth, building sustainable value in our own business and for our partners. As always, thank you to our Googlers around the world for a great start to the year. To everyone, I look forward to seeing you at I/O. Over to Philipp.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar, and good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s great to be joining you again today. We\u2019re pleased with the strong growth in Google Services revenues in the first quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength in advertiser spend, and lapping of the initial impact of the pandemic on advertising revenues that began in March last year.\nIn the first quarter, in Search, we saw sustained strength across most categories, led by retail. We also saw strong performance in tech and CPG. In YouTube, we had phenomenal growth driven by direct response, followed by continued strength in brand. We're seeing great momentum in TrueView for Action ads with the number of advertisers using the format doubling\n\n over the past year. In Network, exceptional growth was driven by AdMob and Ad Manager with particular strength in App Campaigns. Google Other Revenues were driven by growth in Google Play and YouTube\u2019s non-advertising revenues, followed by Hardware.\nI would now like to take a few minutes to dive deeper into the trends we\u2019re seeing in our business. As Sundar touched on earlier, the pandemic is evolving in different ways across the world. Some countries are in advanced stages of reopening. Others are facing re-acceleration of cases. And there\u2019s everything in between. It's never been more important to help businesses navigate the pandemic as circumstances change.\nOn Travel, we\u2019re starting to see renewed interest from users as they turn to Google to plan their next trip \u2013 even before they\u2019re ready to book. Every travel partner is looking to understand where demand is going, and we\u2019re helping them find these opportunities through insights and automation. For American Airlines, for example, that meant using our insights tools to anticipate demand on untapped routes \u2013 these newly prioritized routes had a significantly higher booking rate in Search this quarter, compared to last quarter.\nAlso, just last month, we made it free for hotels and travel companies to list their booking links \u2013 similar to what we did with Shopping last year. For consumers, it means more choice. For hotels and travel companies, it means free exposure on Google. For advertisers, it means paid campaigns can be augmented with free listings. We\u2019re already seeing positive results across the board.\nLet me switch gears now and talk about retail \u2013 where we had a very strong quarter. As you know, we\u2019ve taken important steps over the past year to accelerate an open retail ecosystem. We made product listings free, removed commission fees, and opened our shopping platform to Shopify and PayPal. We\u2019re also helping retailers lean into some key opportunities. Such as innovating in omni-channel as the line between digital and physical retail continues to blur. And tapping into commercial intent on YouTube and other surfaces. Let me talk about both.\nOver the last six months, people\u2019s shopping preferences have shifted constantly in response to changing conditions. It\u2019s not just online. It\u2019s not just offline. It\u2019s a mix, and that\u2019s our sweet spot with Search, Maps and YouTube. Last quarter, we talked about a surge in searches for \u201cavailable near me\u201d and for \u201ccurbside pickup\u201d. That trend has not changed. Searches for \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cbusinesses\u201d are up 80% versus last year. Omni-channel is here to stay.\nTake Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Throughout the pandemic, they accelerated curbside pickup, pick-up-in-store, and ship-from-store fulfillment options in Search. This approach contributed to 100% year-over-year increase in e-commerce sales in 2020. And, just recently, they activated YouTube to build awareness for new store concepts. Michaels, the arts and crafts store, also activated their omni-channel fulfillment approach using Search and Maps. And to meet surging demand for arts supplies, they used TrueView for Action to tap into the vast number of arts and crafts searches happening on YouTube. In 2020, their e-commerce sales were up 350%.\nWe\u2019re also doing more to help merchants tap into the incredible innate commercial behavior across Search and YouTube. Google Merchants can now plug their product feeds right into their video action campaigns. And early adopters are seeing huge results. Luxury cosmetics company Clarins HK added beautiful product imagery from their Google merchant feed as an\n\n extension and saw a 68% conversion rate uplift within three weeks. Any merchant can now light this up with a single click in our Google Merchant center.\nSpeaking of YouTube \u2013 we\u2019re helping advertisers address both brand and performance goals at scale, driving higher return on ad spend at a time when they need it most. We\u2019re only a few years in on direct response and we think there is significant opportunity for innovation that will improve the user experience and provide better ROI for advertisers. On the performance side, advertisers of all sizes are actually seeing incredible results. Like global group fitness company, LesMills, who was hit hard when their 20,000 partner gyms closed during lockdown. They accelerated digital and grew app subscribers by almost 7x with TrueView for Action.\nWe\u2019re seeing strong growth in YouTube\u2019s brand business, fueled by a global consumer trend from linear TV toward streaming video. With over 2 billion monthly logged in users and over a billion hours of video watched every day, YouTube is offering advertisers efficient reach to large audiences which are incremental to those found on TV. Large brands are benefiting from this trend. Taco Bell saw 27% incremental reach for their limited time offer campaigns, and Kellogg\u2019s saw incremental reach of over 30% for their recent Special K campaign.\nBefore I close, I want to take a minute to highlight our work with partners. Sundar mentioned Google News Showcase \u2013 we now have deals with 600+ publishers across more than 12 countries. Le Monde in France, Der Spiegel and Stern in Germany, Clar\u00edn in Argentina, Evening Standard in the UK \u2013 just to name a few, and we\u2019re continuing to expand the program.\nWe\u2019re also developing more valuable relationships with some of our strategic partners. By teaming up, we\u2019re able to build new experiences for our users while helping our partners innovate and grow. We\u2019ve gone well beyond ads to bring the best of Google across Cloud, Play, YouTube and more to help them do just that. Sundar mentioned Univision. In the quarter, we also announced T-Mobile, Albertsons, Allianz, and Munich Re. I want to thank our customers and partners for their collaboration \u2013 we\u2019ve always said, we succeed only when they succeed. And I also want to thank our product, partnership, sales, and support teams for their amazing work and innovation. I\u2019ll now hand off the call to Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp. Our very strong financial results in the first quarter reflect both lapping the impact of COVID on our business beginning in March 2020 as well as the benefit of excellent underlying operating performance. My focus will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state otherwise. I\u2019ll start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.\nFor the first quarter, our Consolidated Revenues were $55.3 billion, up 34%, or up 32% in constant currency, reflecting elevated consumer activity online and broad-based increases in advertiser spending within Google Services, as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our total cost of revenues was $24.1 billion, up 27%, primarily driven by Other Cost of Revenues which was $14.4 billion, up 25%, followed by TAC, which was $9.7 billion, up 30%. Within Other Cost of Revenues, the biggest factors were, first \u2013 content acquisition costs \u2013 primarily driven by costs for YouTube\u2019s advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content; and second \u2013 costs associated with data centers and other operations, offset partially by a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes to estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment.\n\n Operating expenses were $14.8 billion, up 4%. In terms of the three component parts of opex, first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, Sales & Marketing expenses were essentially flat, reflecting headcount growth which was offset by lower spend on ads and promo, as well as on travel and entertainment. Finally, the decline in G&A reflects the benefit of lapping the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID, offset by charges relating to certain legal matters. Headcount was up 4,694 from the fourth quarter, including more than 1,800 Fitbit employees who joined us in Q1. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. Operating income was $16.4 billion, up 106% and our operating margin in the quarter was 30%.\nOther Income & Expense, was $4.8 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $17.9 billion. Operating Cash Flow was $19.3 billion, with Free Cash Flow of $13.3 billion in the quarter and $50.7 billion for the trailing twelve months. We ended the first quarter with $135 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results.\nStarting with our Google Services segment, total Google Services Revenues were $51.2 billion, up 34%, consisting of Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter, up 30%, with strength across most categories, led by retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.0 billion, up 49%, driven by exceptional performance in direct response and ongoing strength in brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $6.8 billion, up 30%, driven by AdMob and Ad Manager.\nOther Revenues were $6.5 billion, up 46%, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues, followed by Hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. Google Services operating income was $19.5 billion, up 69%, and the operating margin was 38%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace. Revenues were $4.0 billion for the first quarter, up 46%. GCP\u2019s revenue growth was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1.0 billion. As to our Other Bets, in the first quarter revenues were $198 million. The operating loss was $1.1 billion. Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly.\nFor Google Services, for the remainder of 2021, year-over-year comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year \u2013 with a greater benefit in Q2 from an easier comp relative to what you saw in Q1, and then beginning to lap stronger performance in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, we continued to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. It is too early to say how durable this consumer behavior will be as economies recover and restrictions on mobility are lifted.\nWithin Other Revenues, Play benefited from an increased level of user engagement starting in Q1 last year due to the pandemic, which we are now beginning to lap. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, we still intend to invest aggressively to support the extraordinary opportunities we see. That being said, in some areas like travel and entertainment and marketing events, the pace of investment through the balance of the year may be affected by the pace of COVID recovery globally.\nAs for Google Cloud, our approach to building the business has not changed. We remain focused on revenue growth, and we will continue to invest aggressively in products and our go-to-market organization given the opportunity we see. The operating results in Q1 in part reflect some notable items in the quarter, first, the lapping of the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020 as I already mentioned; and second, lower depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives, although the dollar benefit will diminish throughout the course of the year across segments. As we have noted previously, operating results should benefit from increased scale over time; however, at this point we do remain focused on continuing to invest to build the Cloud organization for long-term performance.\nIn terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity. Turning to CapEx at the consolidated level, the results reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, offset by a slower pace of investment in office facilities given the ongoing impact of COVID. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment, as we continue to invest to support Cloud, Search, Ads and Machine Learning.\nFinally, with respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $50 billion of our Class C Stock. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. And to prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one for Sundar. Appreciate the color on the four key priorities. I wanted to dig a little more into the \u201cbuild and provide the most helpful products and services.\u201d Maybe if you can sort of talk to us about Search. How do you think about the key investment priorities and innovation areas to continue to make Search more and more helpful for your users and your advertisers? And the second one for Philipp maybe. Similar question on YouTube. You've done such a great job on innovation around YouTube. Where do you see the largest incremental opportunities for further innovation at YouTube to deliver more outsized value for your advertisers? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks. On Search, great question. I still think we are in very early stages. A recent example which I was proud of was when the ship was stuck in the Suez Canal and then it got out. If you asked a question to Google, I think very soon after that we had the right answer. It seems obvious to do, except we need to provide right answers and without giving wrong answers or misinformation for many other things. So to do that is where all our underlying investments go, and that's how we think about it over the long-term. BERT last year, I think, was a great example of it. It was one of our biggest quality improvements. And that was based on the Transformer breakthrough from our Google AI team which laid the foundation for it. So we are continuing to invest that way \u2013 in the deep technology. As the web is scaling up, there's more information than ever before. So that's a big part of what we are doing. Beyond that, there's a lot of opportunity to improve the user experience. You've seen our efforts around Shopping. That's one aspect of how we are working hard to improve the experience there so \u2013 but we are looking at it pretty deeply. Philipp?\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes. On the YouTube side, let me start with our direct response business. Growth was truly exceptional this quarter. DR was practically nonexistent on YouTube a few years ago, and it's now a large and fast-growing business. And we're just getting started, in my view. People already, as you know, go to YouTube to decide what they want to buy. And we want to make it easier for them to buy and make the discovery process overall a lot easier. And for creators, we launched new shoppable capabilities so viewers can actually make purchases from their favorite creators directly on YouTube.\nJust as an example, as part of our BrandConnect program, Calvin Klein tested these and drove over \u2013 I think it was \u2013 200% lift in brand search and sold out multiple products actually. For merchants, they can now bring their product feeds directly into their video campaigns. And I think we're still scratching the surface on what's possible really with commercial intent on YouTube. And then there's, of course, the opportunity to be a major platform for brands. Historical approaches to reaching audiences through, let's just say, call it, linear TV don't really work anymore. Advertisers are using YouTube now to reach the audiences they can't find anywhere else. And remember, more 18-to-49-year-olds are actually watching YouTube than all linear TV combined. And brands are also seeing more incremental reach on YouTube compared to TV.\nSo we're starting to see advertisers buy a mix, actually, of awareness and more action-oriented formats. And they are driving reach and results across the funnel from awareness to consideration to action. So we see a lot of really interesting opportunities here.\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP\nMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, Ruth, just wanted to ask you about Cloud. You saw some significant benefits just from the change in useful life. But I think in the past, you talked about 1Q perhaps being the biggest loss of the year. I was just curious if that's still the case, in your view, going forward. And then second, just given the management transition that we've seen at Waymo, should we expect any change in terms of how things are operated there going forward? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thanks for the question. So in terms of Cloud and overall performance \u2013 I think, the main point I would say is, I wouldn't extrapolate generally from quarter to quarter, given we're still in the early stages of building the business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully in Cloud, given the opportunity. And so, as you said, there were\n\n a couple of things that benefited margins in the quarter, both the depreciation expense item, but also lapping the unusually high allowance for credit losses that were recorded back in the first quarter.\nSo the main takeaway is we're continuing to invest. We'll invest aggressively in products and go-to-market, what we\u2019ve talked about quite consistently over time. And as much as operating losses and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time, at this point, we do remain focused on investing to build the organization for long-term performance.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: And, Doug, on Waymo, John is stepping down as CEO. And he's been planning for this transition, and Dmitri and Tekedra have been working closely with him. And so we'll continue our investments there. Pretty excited that the fully autonomous experience of Waymo One is available in Phoenix, and we are also accelerating the development of our next-generation Waymo Driver to deploy it in San Francisco. And this past quarter, Waymo began limited rider testing in San Francisco. And so really focused on making sure we make the hard technical progress so that we can operationalize this. And so we will continue executing towards that.\nDoug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Okay. Thank you, both.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nYour line is now open.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks. As it relates to some of the harder-hit industries, I'm curious if you could just characterize the shape of the recovery, what you're seeing across travel and some of the other sectors. And have there been any verticals that you have yet to see recover that may pull out in the second half of the year? Thank you.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So overall, what we indicated is that the strong results reflect, in part, lapping the impact that we saw starting late in Q1 of last year and then a pickup in a number of areas. I think the main thing we'd want to leave you with is that we are seeing, in part, an acceleration in the shift to digital. But it's too early to forecast the extent to which these changes in consumer behavior and advertising spend will endure. There's some obvious examples. If you think about, for example, the bump in consumption for things like outfitting your home to work from home, obviously, that doesn't repeat. And so our main thing is we think it's premature at this point to really assess how durable those consumer behavior trends are.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): In travel specifically, can you just give us any color in terms of what you're seeing on that front?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Nothing more to add. Philipp had a couple of comments about some of the areas where we're trying to innovate to be helpful to our partners. But beyond that, nothing to add.\nBrent Thill (Jefferies): Great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Maybe one for Philipp and one for Ruth. First, Philipp, you've mentioned a couple times the durability of the improvement is tough to gauge. Maybe you could help us understand what the key drivers of Search are that you're thinking about over the next couple years. Is it queries? Product improvements? Certain changes in verticals like Shopping? How are you thinking about driving Search growth? And then maybe for Ruth, models showed great efficiency last year on the cost side and margins. Anything you're learning or experiences during the pandemic that we can think about post-pandemic on cost efficiencies or things like that? Thank you.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes, thank you. Thank you so much for the question. I usually look at the different components of Search as basically four key drivers. The first one, obviously, being the queries. So are we really the best place for users to turn to when they need information? The second one is, I would call it, ads coverage. So what percent of queries is really commercial and then what percentage are we actually covering with ads? And then we need to ask ourselves, do both of these have upside?\nThe third one is click-through rates. Are individual ad click-through rates close to being optimized? Is there more we can do here by just delivering better creatives, better ads, better answers? To what extent can we deploy next-generation machine learning here? And then the last one is obviously the CPC, right? How much is someone willing to bid for a click on their ad? And this is obviously to a large extent driven by the quality of traffic we're sending. And then conversion rate is a big driver of this. So working very closely with our partners, advertisers and so on across the world to help them optimize their conversion rates and their ROI. Those are really the four big components, and I'm excited about all four of them actually.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: And in terms of your question on efficiency, I appreciate the question. I think at the highest level, the approach is unchanged. Our approach on investing and capital allocation is, first and foremost, to support long-term growth with financially sustainable businesses. It's about being sharper within product areas and then making sure we're investing in what I keep referring to as operational excellence, things like our technical infrastructure, systems to improve productivity, to improve velocity of our product teams and then the very important efforts around privacy and security and content moderation.\nAnd I think, to your question, the experiences of this past year underscored, really, the value of having made those investments to protect and support operational excellence. It really served us well, and customers, in our ability to deliver throughout this period of time. So that framework is unaltered. I think that part of what you're seeing in the first quarter \u2013 I've said it a couple times now, but are some notable items in the quarter. The lapping of the allowance for credit losses, the benefit from depreciation life. And then there were certain things that were due to COVID \u2013 just the lower impact for things like T&E and marketing.\nAnd so the main point is we will continue to invest for long-term growth. I've said that in both areas, Google Services and Cloud. And we have continued to maintain that framework that you referenced about looking for efficiencies where they are but ensuring that we can deliver for users and customers.\n\nJustin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch): Great. Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from\nBaird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Sundar, first, you've highlighted for years that machine learning is clearly a strength and differentiation of the overall platform, including in Cloud services, where we're also seeing competitors focus more on their capabilities here. So I'm wondering if you can talk about the pace of change around data science and how Google can sustain its competitive advantage in those areas. And then, Philipp, I wanted to follow up on the momentum in Search that you attribute to Google Shopping. Is it fair to say that the shift to free product listings has led to the desired increase in retail advertising across the platform, or are there other reasons beyond the pandemic that you attribute for that success? Thanks.\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Colin, thanks. And, obviously, as we are thinking about AI, it all starts with foundational R&D we do. I think we are one of the largest R&D investors in AI in the world. And so thinking ahead and doing that, and we're doing it across all the foundational areas. And we are taking many diverse approaches. So as we make breakthroughs \u2013 I earlier spoke about Transformers and how that translated as BERT to improve search quality.\nAnd similarly, we are very committed to taking the AI improvements and bringing it through our GCP offerings to our enterprise customers as well. So it's an approach we are deeply committed to. And we're thinking at it with all layers of the stack. So this is why you see us work hard on TPUs and we think about the toolchain for developers on top of all that. And so \u2013 and I think when I look at the progress ahead, I think there's a lot more progress coming down the pipe, and so I'm pretty excited. And it's why I feel Google \u2013 GCP will be differentiated over time as our competitive advantage plays out here.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes. And on the Shopping side, look, it's been a year since we brought Bill on board, Bill Ready, and we pivoted our Shopping strategy to better support retailers and consumers, trying to really build an open retail ecosystem. And we're pleased with the progress we're making. As you said, free listings and zero commissions have actually lowered barriers for online retail.\nShopping Ads continue to be a powerful way for resellers to promote their products, and the combination of free and paid is a meaningful one. We had a set of new partnerships with Shopify and PayPal that are giving retailers a lot more choice. And we will continue to simplify the, let me call it, end-to-end user and merchant experience, of course. In particular, we are trying to streamline and working hard to streamline the backend experience for merchants, especially for hybrid retailers, so retailers that play in both brick-and-mortar and in digital. And overall, we want to make it much, much easier for retailers to get started on Google and have their information appear across surfaces. And I mentioned the overall strength in retail before. So thank you.\nColin Sebastian (Baird): Thanks, guys.\n\n Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from ISI. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney (Evercore ISI): Thanks. I wanted to ask about your attempts to retain advertisers. And I ask it this way. I think we've had record numbers of new business formations in the country and around the world on the unfortunate impact of COVID. But I think that's \u2013 my guess is it's been a huge tailwind for your business. At the same time, we've had this real tipover, I think, of linear TV ad budgets in the back half of the year to online channels like YouTube. So talk about these new advertisers that you've brought onto the Google platform, what you've been able to do, how confident you are in your ability to retain them, your advertiser retention strategy. Thanks a lot.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: So I can take this. I mean, a lot of the new advertisers that you're referring to are obviously SMBs. And there's no doubt that this has been a challenging year for SMBs. The pandemic has disrupted how many of them connect with their customers. But, frankly, the pandemic has also been a catalyst for key consumer trends, obviously creating a lot of new opportunities for small businesses. And obviously consumers are spending more time online. They're buying more online. They were willing to try new brands. And they're eager to support local businesses, SMBs.\nSo searches for \"support local businesses\" are up significantly since last year. And we've been focused, really, on helping SMBs with simpler tools so they can actually embrace digital a lot faster. And that's where we have really invested over the year \u2013 making everything simpler. We had a very wide range of solutions to help them get online, get discovered across all of our key products \u2013 Search, Maps, YouTube and so on. And there's multiple, multiple fascinating stories from them coming back to us. And we see this positively reflected in our rates here as well.\nMark Mahaney (Evercore ISI): Okay. Thank you, Philipp.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from\nMoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thank you. I have two, one for Philipp, one for Ruth. Philipp, on the questions on Search, when we step back, which categories, which geographies do you think you're still underrepresented as a percentage of marketing spending \u2013 where we could see potentially even more lift to come? And then to Ruth, we always asked in the past about capex spending \u2013 we know the change in useful life. But I wonder, has this pandemic changed maybe your approach to the office space that you bought and thinking about how the company's going to deploy capital in terms of space going forward and how you think about the future of capex in the next couple years based on post-pandemic?\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Philipp seems to be on mute. I'll go ahead and start on the capex question.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Okay. Okay. Thanks, Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of capex, I think \u2013 I'll address two parts.\nYou asked about office facilities, but I do think it's important to note, we are continuing to invest 12\n\n in our technical infrastructure, and that's what you saw again here this quarter, and we'll continue to do so to support growth that we're seeing in Cloud and Search and Ads and Machine Learning. No change there so you'll be seeing that, but the core of your question was really about office facilities.\nAnd I think it's \u2013 we've been very clear we do value bringing people together in the office. And we're looking at a hybrid work from home, work from office model. As we look forward at developing our real estate footprint for offices, what we factor into it is, first, we are growing our headcount. We are looking at less density per employee. So even with a hybrid work environment, we will continue to need space. And so we're continuing to build out our campuses and office facilities.\nWhat you saw in the first quarter was a slightly slower pace of that and a slower pace on fit outs as well as we're evolving what does this space look like. But we expect to continue to pick up the pace there as we fit out our spaces for this kind of new, reimagined environment. So, yes, we'll continue to be investing in campuses around the globe as we have been.\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes. And on your first part of your question, look, we're looking at our business from a very global perspective and are excited about it. Keep in mind, we're not just addressing above the line marketing budgets from an addressable market perspective. So not just traditional advertising, TV advertising and so on. Below the line budgets are really significant, everything \u2013 promotional pricing, product placement, sponsorships and so on and so on.\nSo there's this massive acceleration in e-commerce due to the pandemic. Still, more than 80% of commerce is still offline, so there's a huge opportunity here across the world for us to tap\ninto \u2013 into those other budgets. They were really traditionally used in a very different context. So there's plenty of room for growth here. And I talked about how we look at it from a queries perspective, from a commercial intent perspective. We're trying to use machine learning really smartly here. But the real focus in the end has to be how do we actually make our partners successful, how do we drive incremental ROI for them? And as long as we continue this, well, I think we should continue to see budgets move our way as well.\nMichael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald\nfrom Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBrian Fitzgerald (Wells Fargo): Hey, guys, you mentioned the strength in the supply-side products in the Network business. Wondering if you might be able to comment on how the demand-side products are doing? And maybe in a similar vein, some of the changes you've made in ad technology over the last few years may have had the effect of drawing some of your advertiser customers more deeply into your tech stack. Wondering if this is also creating a strong onramp in GCP specifically around data analytics products like BigQuery? Thanks.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: So in terms of overall on Network revenues, as I think I noted briefly in opening comments, what we're really seeing is the ongoing strength in advertiser spend. Both Philipp and I talked about that. Particularly what we saw was AdMob and Ad Manager and particular strength in App Campaigns. And all of this just underscores what each of us commented on, that the results do reflect what was broad-based strength across our partners' properties in the first quarter.\nBrian Fitzgerald (Wells Fargo): Thanks, Ruth.\nRuth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you.\nCandice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2021 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\nCandice (Operator): This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."}
