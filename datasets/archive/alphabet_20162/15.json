" Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.1 billion, with free cash flow of $7.0 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $78.5 billion, of which approximately $48 billion, or 61%, is held overseas. This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program."
