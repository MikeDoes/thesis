"Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.0 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 18% year-over-year, and up 5% sequentially. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly as a result of a mix shift between Sites revenue, which carries lower TAC, and network revenue. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC."
