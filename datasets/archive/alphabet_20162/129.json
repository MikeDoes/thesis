"Colin Sebastian (Baird): Great. Thanks. I guess two quick questions. First off, we understand that Google Shopping in particular continues to see strong growth. And I was hoping you could add some color on the relative mix or growth rates of PLA contrasting other ad types, along with the adoption of transactional capabilities. And then, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on some of the conversational and voice applications and devices that you have in the pipeline, and more generally, how you envision voice really fitting in across the board, across the Google platform. Will this be sort of a centerpiece as you also utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence? I'd like to, you know, hear more about your vision for that. Thank you."
