"Android is thriving. In the last year alone, we have delivered over 65 billion app installs and are helping developers reach an audience of over one billion users every single month. Our partners are also seeing incredible success with flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S7. It's a hit with consumers and a shining example of how to build a great experience on Android. Our latest version of Android, called Nougat, focuses on performance, productivity, and security. And it also has a VR mode built in to help developers create immersive smartphone VR experiences."
