"Ellen West, VP - Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Aurora, an incredible new artist from Norway who is finding a rapidly growing audience on YouTube all over the world. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our form 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth."
