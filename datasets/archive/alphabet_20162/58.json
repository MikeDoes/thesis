"We also introduced a new undersea cable system, the highest-capacity system ever built, which brings added capacity and performance to support our enterprise customers around the globe. This system has 60 terabytes per second of total capacity, more than any active undersea cable, and is ten million times faster than your cable modem. This is especially exciting as we prepare to launch a new Google Cloud Platform East Asia region in Tokyo later this year."
