"More generally, from advertising to cloud to digital content to hardware and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google. Today's great innovations are being driven by investments in mobile. Tomorrow's will be driven from our investments in machine learning and new computing platforms. But one thing is constant: We'll continue to focus on building the best experiences for billions of people around the world. I want to thank all of the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help them bring to life for our users and partners. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth."
