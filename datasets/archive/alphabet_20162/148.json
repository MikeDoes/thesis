"You know, the thing that's really motivating for us is when you look at over 30,000 car deaths in the U.S. alone, you know, that's what really inspired the founders to start working on this issue. And our approach is quite different from most others. We're focused on fully autonomous cars because in early testing we saw the risk of depending on drivers to remain engaged once you give them the option to switch off. So we've invested a lot there."
