"At I/O, I was excited to share our vision around the Google Assistant. We want to help people get things done in a conversational way across devices and contexts. This is possible thanks to advances in machine learning, voice and image recognition, and natural language processing, which we have invested in for years. You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app Allo and our voice-activated device, Google Home. And we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area."
