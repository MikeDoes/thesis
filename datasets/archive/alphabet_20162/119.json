"Mark Mahaney (RBC): Thanks. I just want to ask one question, and it has to do with mobile search. And I want to throw an idea by you, which is, we've been going through this mobile transition for four or five years. Consumers have, I think, dramatically led businesses and advertisers to mobile devices. I'm wondering if what you're now seeing is finally, as eCommerce and travel and other commerce activities have really become critical and material on mobile devices, you're finally starting to see ad budgets really shift over and you're starting to get auction dynamics starting to pick up in mobile search. So if you could just comment on whether you're finally seeing this kind of back swing for advertisers to engage with mobile search in a way that you really hadn't seen before, it just took that many years for this to happen. Thanks."
