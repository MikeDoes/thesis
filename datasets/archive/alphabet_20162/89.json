"Eric Sheridan, UBS: Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe following up on Carlos's question on Search and, Ruth, your answer, I wanted to go a little deeper on the retail and the travel verticals. It's two areas where we see a lot of innovation from the company right now, both on the product side that consumers are seeing, as well as on the advertising side. How -- how should we think about the roadmap ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals, as well as the ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the company over the medium to long term?"
