"We now have new leadership in place across sales, professional services, marketing, and partnering, plus new customer-facing support in the form of professional services. We have an office of the CTO and customer reliability. So, you know, it's a big set of changes. And it's obviously having an impact. Many of our customers are also partners, and so it's increasingly clear how much we can do together."
