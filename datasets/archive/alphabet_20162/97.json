"Sundar Pichai: Thanks, Heather. Absolutely. You know, I think that Diane has initiated a set of changes, you know. And, essentially, she has integrated our go-to-market strategy with our engineering and product efforts. She has integrated our engineering efforts around the cloud. So, for example, Google Apps, Drive, Docs, Gmail, Slides, Sheets, Hangouts, et cetera, is on top of the cloud stack. Our enterprise customers and partners, you know, for them, now they have one enterprise face. And internally, from frictionless contracts, to touch points across Google, to one person to work with them on our considerable enterprise technologies and products, so the big unifying one being Cloud."
