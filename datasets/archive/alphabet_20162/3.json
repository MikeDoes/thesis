"Candice (Operator): Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Q2 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-donly mode. Later, we will conduct a Q&A session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your Touch-Tone telephone. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Ellen West, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."
