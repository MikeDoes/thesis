"Douglas Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two. First, Sundar, you talked about expanded text ads. And my question was just, you know, as the number of characters here increases, some would say up to 50% through expanded text ads, you're taking up more space on the page, how do you balance the higher percentage of clicks from these paid ads with the natural search experience?"
