"As I've said, machine learning has been a major focus and a key differentiator for Google. And that's true for our Google Cloud customers as well. This quarter, we introduced Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which can deliver an order of magnitude better optimized performance per watt for machine learning projects. Google DeepMind's AlphaGo was powered by TPUs, enabling it to process faster and look farther ahead between moves. We are now passing this benefit on to our enterprise customers to supercharge their machine learning applications."
