"Heather Bellini (Goldman Sachs): Thank you very much. Sundar, I was wondering, I know you gave us some color on the cloud business just a few moments ago in your prepared remarks. But I was wondering if you could share with us some of the changes, if you could highlight some of them that Diane has made since she's come on board. And I'm wondering how some of those changes might be starting to impact conversations with potential customers that you're having. And in particular, just trying to get a sense of, are you seeing Google now with GCP getting invited to more RFPs and starting to see your win rates go up as a result of some of her initiatives? Thank you."
