"In the U.S., we recently introduced a voter tool so when you search for \"Register to vote,\" you'll get a detailed state-by-state guide with information on how to register, requirements, and deadlines. Our new keyboard for iOS called Gboard is off to a great start. People love the ability to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type, and quickly send emojis. And after just one year, Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories."
