"Carlos Kirjner, Bernstein: Thank you. I have two questions. First is about search revenues. I know Search is probably a $50 billion business, and from today's results, it's clearly still growing strongly. Of course, as the business gets larger, it becomes harder and harder to sustain growth. As you look at this increasing growth challenge on your product innovations in Search, including the recent changes and also those that you have in your road map for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenue growth and the trajectory over which they will ultimately decelerate?"
