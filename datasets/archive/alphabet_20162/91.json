"Ruth Porat: Okay. So why don't I start on your second question, and then I'll pass it to Sundar on the first question. So, you know, as you know, we announced the share repurchase program relatively recently, it was just the third quarter of last year, and we just completed it, as per my opening comments. As we discussed back in the third quarter, we do always review our balance sheet and capital requirements and opportunities with our board. And I'm not going to speculate about a potential for a future board decision. So really nothing more to add at this point. And then Sundar?"
