"Sundar Pichai: You know, our overall hardware strategy, you know, we have always -- we have done devices like Nexus or Google Pixel, et cetera. We realize a lot of computing innovations happen at the intersection of hardware and software. And as we are building ecosystems and broad platforms, we need a way to drive them forward, and so that's the context in which we do. There are areas where we have done it very seriously, like Chromecast is a great example. You know, we now have over 30 million Chromecast devices sold. And, you know, that's an example of where we invest deeply. And especially as newer areas, like Google Home, we want our ability to put the best experience possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that's how we think about it."
