"You know, for example, I think if you take something like Duo today, I think especially on Android, you know, high-quality messaging is an experience that's still, you know, lacking for users. So we clearly see an opportunity there. And it's at the core of our mission, bringing informational experiences to users. And so that's why we are investing. And we are optimistic about this space."
