"On YouTube, you know, I think about it as -- you know, we are seeing, you know, strong growth. You know, I mentioned the momentum behind Google Preferred and how we are at double the rate we were last year. So to me, that implies, you know, strong growth. It's tough for us to assess whether it's from TV or just, you know, advertisers investing more because there's traction on YouTube. But, you know, we just see strong momentum. And, you know, as far as we -- you know, today -- when I just look at how users are using mobile, video is the killer app -- killer format on mobile. And I think that's what gives us the secular trend moving forward."
