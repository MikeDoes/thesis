" Since the last earnings call, we had Google I/O, our biggest event of the year. And I also wrote our annual Founders' Letter. Both of these allowed me to reflect on our past and look to our future. We are at a pivotal and transformational moment. Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next ten years. In the letter, I wrote about how we think of our investments and our mission. Today, I'll walk through the six sections of the Founders' Letter and discuss our progress in each area, and then I'll call out three key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the future."
