"We're also continuing to push the frontier with tech innovation, as you noted in your question, and different execution paths. So, you know, as you said in the question, we're exploring both Fiber and wireless. And you may have seen our recent acquisition of Webpass. So we want to make sure we're executing against a very large and attractive market in the most effective and efficient manner. We did start adding customers in Charlotte in July. And so, again, we view it as a big opportunity. We're being thoughtful and deliberate in our execution path."
