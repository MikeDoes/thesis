"Thanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store, or downloading your app. For instance, Walgreens partnered closely with Google to promote their app across Search, Google Play, and our display networks. In one month, they increased the number of app downloads 87% from the previous month."
