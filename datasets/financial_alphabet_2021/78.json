"We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $3.8 billion and $4.3\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2020 and March\u00a031, 2021. Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $2.6 billion and $3.0\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2020 and March\u00a031, 2021. Although the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months."
