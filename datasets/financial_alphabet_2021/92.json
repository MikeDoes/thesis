"YouTube ads revenues increased $1,967 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021. Growth was primarily driven by our direct response products followed by our brand advertising products, both of which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased advertiser spending. The adverse effect of COVID-19 on prior period revenues also contributed to the year-over-year increase."
