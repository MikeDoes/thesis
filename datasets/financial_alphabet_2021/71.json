"In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (\"Oracle\") brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces (\u201cJava APIs\u201d). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the Solicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7, 2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling and found that Google\u2019s use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter of law. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion."
