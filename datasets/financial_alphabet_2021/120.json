"Google services operating income increased $7,998 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase was due to growth in revenues partially offset by increases in TAC, content acquisition costs and compensation expenses. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment. The adverse effect of COVID-19 on prior period results also positively affected the year-over-year increase in operating income."
