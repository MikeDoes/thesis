Several enzymes can work together in a specific order , creating metabolic pathways . 	creating	Several enzymes	metabolic pathways
Several enzymes can work together in a specific order , creating metabolic pathways . 	can work	Several enzymes	together in a specific order
In a metabolic pathway , one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate . 	takes	one enzyme	the product of another enzyme	as a substrate
After the catalytic reaction , the product is then passed on to another enzyme . 	passed	the product	to another enzyme
Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel ; this can allow more complex regulation : with , for example , a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme . 	can allow	this	more complex regulation
